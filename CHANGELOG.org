* Version 1.10.0 on 2025-04-29
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:728b510a-3e93-433f-9c3c-582f716321f9
:END:

This version introduces minor refinements to an already stable
package.

** The palette preview uses a tabulated interface
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:2db8bd88-b941-4c55-b8c3-f54a85666def
:END:

The commands ~ef-themes-preview-colors~ and ~ef-themes-preview-colors-current~
produce a preview of the given theme's palette. In the past, we were
using a bespoke buffer for this task, just how the built-in command
~list-colors-display~ does it.

Now we rely on the built-in ~tabulated-list-mode~ to get a cleaner
tabulated view. Plus, users can sort by column.

** Support for more faces or face groups
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:296dadf4-a87d-4cf1-8058-959f65dfc2b4
:END:

- Added support for my ~tmr~ package. This will be especially
  noticeable in its tabulated view (used to show timers, with the
  command ~tmr-tabulated-view~ (alias ~tmr-list-timers~)).

- Added explicit support for my ~spacious-padding~ package.
  Specifically, this is for the faces ~spacious-padding-subtle-mode-line-active~
  and ~spacious-padding-subtle-mode-line-inactive~. Those can be
  configured as part of the user option ~spacious-padding-subtle-mode-line~.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq spacious-padding-subtle-mode-line
        '( :mode-line-active spacious-padding-subtle-mode-line-active
           :mode-line-inactive spacious-padding-subtle-mode-line-inactive))
  #+end_src

- Made the ~helpful~ headings use whatever the style of level 1
  headings is, as defined by the user option ~ef-themes-heading~.
  Thanks to John Haman for applying the relevant code we have for the
  ~modus-themes~. The change is small (and comes from my ~modus-themes~,
  anyway), meaning that John does not need to assign copyright to the
  Free Software Foundation.

- Added support for the ~howm~ package.

- Extended support for the ~auto-dim-other-buffers~ package to include
  its ~auto-dim-other-buffers-hide-face~.

- Made sure that all new ~transient~ faces conform with the design
  priorities of the themes. Concretely, this means that they do not
  support any colour-coding: all keys look the same, regardless of
  whether they mean "continue", "exit", or anything else.
  Colour-coding with a full spectrum of colours cannot be accessible
  (and I do not believe colour-coding alone even works because the
  colours have nothing else to be associated with, like how a red line
  in a diff buffer also goes together with the minus sign).

  Thanks to Kevin Fleming for including the ~transient-key-stack~ face
  that I had originally missed. This was done in pull request 54:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/54>. The change is
  small, meaning that Kevin does not need to assign copyright to the
  Free Software Foundation

- Extended support for ~adoc-mode~ courtesy of Leilei332. This was
  done in pull request 52: <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/52>.
  
  The change is within the ~15-line limit, meaning that its author does
  not need to assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation.

* Version 1.9.0 on 2024-11-16
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3c1baf6a-69f1-4109-9a5e-b587beda56bc
:END:

This version introduces several small refinements to an already
comprehensive basis.

** No interference with ~org-modern~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4e0013a0-6ee5-44bc-96e0-f6fbfe5aa58e
:END:

The ~org-modern~ package is not meant to be touched by a theme. This
is what I am doing with the ~modus-themes~, but I forgot to remove the
changes made by the ~ef-themes~.

Thanks to Daniel Mendler, author of ~org-modern~, for bringing this
matter to my attention. This was done in issue 48:
<https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/48>.

** Colour refinements for several themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e50f8982-6f8e-4c98-ad1d-5f70a5e19108
:END:

I document those, though most of them will not be noticeable, unless
on a side-by-side comparison.

- The ~ef-day~ palette value for =green-warmer= has a marginally
  greater contribution from the red channel of light, making it a tiny
  bit "warmer". The =green-faint= is made less warm. In context, these
  tweaks make certain elements easier to tell apart, while retaining
  the character of the theme.

- The ~ef-reverie~ value for =blue-faint= is less saturated, so its
  blue impression is diminished. It still performs its role in all the
  relevant contexts, only now it does it better by not competing with
  other shades of blue.

- The ~ef-light~ value for =fg-dim= is much less intense, though still
  within the desired contrast range. This way, it works better in
  context. The "added" background colours (used in ~diff-mode~, Ediff,
  Magit, etc.) are a little bit more intense to be more harmonious
  with other elements in a diff output. The =blue-faint= has lower
  contribution from the blue channel of light in the interest of not
  interfering with other blue hues, while still looking alright
  itself. The semantic palette mapping for links now uses the
  =blue-warmer= colour instead of =blue=, as the former is less
  ambiguous in context. The =fg-alt= is recalibrated to be closer to a
  grey value, improving its use in several places. The =red-cooler=
  value is redone to not be conflated with magenta: it now delivers a
  rosy red impression. Lastly, the =rainbow-2= mapping uses =magenta=
  instead of =magenta-warmer= for consistency in all relevant
  situations.

- The ~ef-night~ semantic colour mapping of =preprocessor= is toned
  down in intensity to remove what was a stylistic exaggeration. The
  =variable= mapping is tweaked to use =cyan-warmer= instead of the
  =cyan= colour, as the former is slightly more suited to the role due
  to how it combines with other colours. The =type= semantic mapping
  is bound to a less intense shade of magenta, making it not overpower
  other constructs in a competition for attention. Finally, the value
  of the =magenta-faint= colour has a greater contribution from the
  blue channel of light to shift its hue slightly closer to purple.

- The ~ef-deuteranopia-light~ palette entry for =red-faint= is more
  yellow to be discernible where needed. Similarly, the =cyan-cooler=
  has a reduced contribution from the red channel of light.

  [ Note that the "deuteranopia" and "tritanopia" themes define all
    colours in the palette to be consistent with the overall project,
    but only use hues that are appropriate for red-green and blue-yellow
    colour deficiency, respectively. ]

- The "subtle" backgrounds of all themes (e.g. =bg-red-subtle=) are
  redone to feel more natural in the context of their respective
  theme. Before, some values were a bit exaggerated and/or not aligned
  with the overall aesthetic. Still, the changes are small: do not
  expect your preferred theme to be refashioned.

** More accurate faces for Org agenda dates
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4a7e91bb-4661-4b89-a0c1-d321f07c30c1
:END:

The faces used by Org agenda to style events with a scheduled date or
deadline are redesigned to better complement the semantics of what is
on display. Pressing tasks stand out more, while those that do not
require immediate attention are rendered in a more subtle style.

Thanks to Adam Porter (aka GitHub alphapapa) for suggesting this
revision and discussing the technicalities with me. This was done in
issue 102 of the Modus themes repository (but the principles apply to
the Ef themes as well): <https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/102>.

** The ~forge~ package is fully supported
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:53ab2d2a-6dac-460e-baa5-0b0ed286e0a4
:END:

All of its faces will now look consistent in context as they get the
appropriate colours of the active Ef theme.

Thanks to Len Trigg for reporting that some attributes were not
suitable for the intended purpose of certain Forge faces. I fixed
those accordingly. This was done in issue 47:
<https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/47>.

** Support for the ~tldr~ package
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:af882be2-c75f-455e-97ab-4b8661ee0dab
:END:

This makes it look consistent with the rest of the theme.

** Support for the built-in ~window-tool-bar-mode~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:9330925f-1b6c-4e58-93e6-8c35b3e09eb4
:END:

This is a mode available in Emacs 30. Its faces will look right at all
times.

** Support for the built-in ~hexl-mode~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:eb519edb-0764-436c-be84-50e9453b6140
:END:

Instead of using shades of grey backgrounds, the themes use carefully
chosen foreground values that are easier to spot.

** The ~embark~ faces are brought up-to-date
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:43da4e08-96ab-4a3f-9f90-654dfa23a420
:END:

Old symbols are removed and the current ones are added in their stead.

** Miscellaneous
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:cae41822-d05a-42b5-b0e8-e6e42dc9bc73
:END:

- The =:background-mode= property of the ~ef-melissa-dark~ theme is
  set to the correct symbol. Thanks to Pedro Cunha for making the
  change in pull request 46: <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/46>.
  The change is small, so Pedro does not need to assign copyright to
  the Free Software Foundation.

- Graphical buttons inherit the ~ef-themes-button~ face, which makes
  it easier to ensure theme-wide consistency for all relevant faces.

- The ~all-the-icons~ faces for Ibuffer use different colours that
  refine how everything looks in context.

- The popup produced by the ~corfu~ and ~company~ packages will use a
  monospaced font (inherit from ~fixed-pitch~) if the user option
  ~ef-themes-mixed-fonts~ is set to a non-nil value.

- The annotation function used by the command ~ef-themes-select~ or
  related now uses the ~completions-annotations~ face, as it should.

* Version 1.8.0 on 2024-08-27
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b00cf88f-791c-4d58-a3e7-56677b1ff448
:END:

The ~ef-themes~ package is in a stable state. The collection covers a
wide spectrum of tastes while maintaining a high standard of legibility.
I have made a few quality-of-life refinements and added two exciting
new themes.

** Enjoy the ~ef-eagle~ and ~ef-owl~ themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7790dd2e-bcea-4f1e-b591-50bc38ec3a11
:END:

These are the two new members of the collection. Both draw inspiration
from the large predatory birds I encounter in my mountains. Both
themes avoid the use of highly saturated colours.

- ~ef-eagle~ is a light theme with varying shades of brown and
  complementary colours.

- ~ef-owl~ is a dark theme with varying shades of silverblue and
  complementary colours.

The announcement I made on my blog about these two themes includes
pictures of them: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-08-19-ef-eagle-and-owl-themes/>.

** The "midnight" mode of ~pdf-tools~ is supported
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:24d42d8f-afec-4936-99f9-d780060b65cc
:END:

The ~pdf-tools~ package provides the ~pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode~,
which applies dark colours to the document. Those colours will now be
taken from the active theme, resulting in a more consistent reading
experience.

** Org checkboxes are monospaced if needed
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:9a19b8b1-a853-4ee4-b520-42e6ae7f6f7a
:END:

When the user sets the option ~ef-themes-mixed-fonts~ to a non-nil
value, the Org checkboxes will be rendered in a monospaced font
(technically, they inherit the ~fixed-pitch~ face). This is done to
preserve the alignment of items when ~variable-pitch-mode~ is enabled
(or the user sets a proportionately spaced font as their default).

Remember that the point of "mixed fonts" is to use monospacing for
those elements that are space-sensitive, like code blocks and tables.

Thanks to Gautier Ponsinet for making the Org checkboxes conform with
this design. The change is small and thus does not require copyright
assignment to the Free Software Foundation.

** The ~elisp-shorthand-font-lock-face~ is now easier to spot
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:80d4a3a9-558e-4147-aea6-1512f0320653
:END:

This is a way for Emacs packages to define so-called "shorthands" of
short prefixes in symbols that are aliases for longer ones. For
example, =my-long-package-name-prefix= may be expressed as =mlp= in
the source code. These shorthands will now use a style that is not
found anywhere else in Elisp code, making them stand out more.

** A better "alt" foreground for ~ef-melissa-light~ and ~ef-melissa-dark~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:02f6005b-2f72-4d51-a327-5f8eddcf1da0
:END:

The themes define an alternative foreground colour which is used for
ancillary elements such as Org property drawers. For
~ef-melissa-light~ and ~ef-melissa-dark~ this colour is easier to tell
apart from the colour used for comments. It still retains the same
pleasant quality of being easy-to-read without calling too much
attention to itself.

** The new ~bg-search-match~ semantic colour mapping
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:340b496a-1e19-453f-9b02-768a79023dd5
:END:

Each theme has a palette that defines named colours and semantic
mappings. These are useful for my purposes while developing the
themes, but also for users who have the option to override the palette
(check the manual for further details).

The ~bg-search-match~ is used for "matches" that are persistent in
search results, such as in Occur and Grep buffers. The colour in use
is the same as it was before, except that the user can now modify it
directly.

* Version 1.7.0 on 2024-04-28
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c5de16f9-1f16-46b9-b9fa-07b9b6b9bcfc
:END:

This version contains minor refinements for many of the themes in the
collection. It also introduces two new themes which, according to
private feedback I have received, are already well received.

** Experience the ~ef-dream~ and ~ef-reverie~ themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a6160334-8fca-4d2c-9a16-6163f5fb051c
:END:

Both themes revolve around the use of gold tones and subtle
complementary colours.

I announced them here: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-04-09-emacs-ef-dream-reverie-themes/>.

The ~ef-themes~ now cover a wide range of tastes, all while conforming
with a high legibility standard (minimum WCAG AA, though many qualify
for WCAG AAA).

** Refinements for some themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:889befd9-24c1-4fba-86f4-330eee02030e
:END:

These are small changes that improve the consistency of the given
theme.

*** ef-bio
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e98052b9-af8f-4360-8c88-5cfb093a40bb
:END:

The =preprocessor= semantic palette mapping uses a cyan-green colour
instead of a vibrant green. This is to better differentiate elements
in code, while remaining faithful to the style of the theme.

*** ef-cyprus
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5f9e7d77-fa2b-444a-9d0d-1704e3450ec9
:END:

The =preprocessor= semantic palette mapping is redefined from a faint
yellow to a firebrick red. This is to ensure that the various
combinations of elements in code are easy to tell apart while
remaining pleasant to look at.

*** ef-day
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:281a61e3-7a46-4940-b20e-3d0e7507e2d0
:END:

The =green-faint= value has reduced contribution from the blue channel
of light, making it more green-yellow as a result. This colour is only
used for comments: it achieves the two-fold goal of (i) applying
subtle colouration to comments while (ii) making them sufficiently
distinct from their context.

*** ef-dark
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8328c714-247f-4917-8de1-97674aea88f8
:END:

The value of the =preprocessor= is a bit darker red than its former
brighter variant. This is to improve the visuals in files that include
a high concentration of preprocessor constructs.

*** ef-duo-light
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ee767a74-ae4f-49b2-916f-a4a2100d63ec
:END:

- The =cyan-warmer= entry in the palette is a bit less blue and more
  green. The change is imperceptible on its own (from =#3f6faf= to
  =#3f70a0=). The effect is more noticeable in the context of other
  constructs, such as in an Org document that combines headings of
  varying levels, with code and verbatim inline elements, as well as
  links.

- The =comment= semantic palette mapping uses a slightly more orange
  value. This is done for stylistic consistency with the rest of the
  theme, while making comments a bit easier to spot.

*** ef-duo-dark
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8c50cfdd-acfd-4240-b8d3-41bdfbc215ec
:END:

As with its light counterpart, the =comment= entry in the palette uses
a slightly different colour value. The effect is subtle and only
appreciated in context.

*** ef-frost
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ed7e4bfd-23e0-4acf-9621-ba0a97d92796
:END:

The =yellow-faint= palette entry is considerably more yellow than its
previous value. The reason for this change is to make comments and
tags in Org headings stand out more when compared to some other subtle
elements. The exact value of this yellow still feels ice-cold, like
the rest of the theme.

*** ef-kassio
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4fb0d0a7-0086-4625-9b4e-2e5eb599997e
:END:

The =comment= semantic palette mapping uses a slightly more cyan
value. Comments are easier to tell apart from their context, while
retaining the spirit of their original design.

*** ef-light
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a149da6b-716c-41ba-a25e-3784742ea0e8
:END:

- The =blue= entry in the palette is darker than before. This makes
  the links it is applied to easier to spot in their context.

- The =blue-faint= is a bit less purple/indigo than before. It is now
  applied to level 1 headings (such as in Org) instead of the previous
  =blue= value. Combined with the above it makes it easier to
  differentiate various elements that are rendered in some shade of
  blue (like Org verbatim and links).

- The =preprocessor= semantic palette mapping uses a slightly darker
  red than before, to better fit in with the rest of the theme.

*** ef-melissa-light
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:962a86e6-4ac2-42ad-9a37-6b3500cb700b
:END:

The =red-warmer=, =red-cooler=, and =yellow= palette entries are
revised in concert to (i) retain the overall balance of the theme
while (ii) making those colours easier to tell apart.

*** ef-rosa
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4748d0cc-8e65-43f7-a243-ab138e24ddc0
:END:

- Links use a different shade of green. It makes for a slightly better
  fit in the context of other elements.

- The =green= value is less saturated. It better complements the
  colours it is combined with, such as pink and magenta.

- The =mail-subject= semantic palette mapping uses the aforementioned
  =green=, as it makes for a better fit in that context.

- The =comment= semantic palette mapping has a faint green value.
  Comments are a bit easier to spot, while they better contribute to
  the aesthetics of the theme.

*** ef-summer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b72deac5-c44a-4438-865e-54878d4bec65
:END:

The =preprocessor= semantic palette mapping has a shade of green that
has greater contribution from the blue channel of light. The first
impression is the same as before, though the exact value is a better
fit for the theme.

*** ef-symbiosis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ece435c8-6f85-412d-a270-1691952a2db5
:END:

The =preprocessor= semantic palette mapping is less intense than
before to make sure there is no impression of exaggeration when there
is a high concentration of it on the screen.

** All light themes use slightly different graph colours
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e2417812-d142-48c2-81e7-d459209b8cd9
:END:

This is a subset of the palette that is used in some special cases
such as the ~org-habit~ consistency graph. The change covers the
lighter green and blue values, which are now easier to spot in their
context.

** The ~doom-modeline~ no longer uses ~bold-italic~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3c13879e-0aa7-4a85-b3dd-d2a8460bde59
:END:

There were two instances where the ~bold-italic~ face was applied.
This could break icons, by clipping their top. We revert to only using
the ~bold~ face.

Thanks to Filippo Argiolas for bringing this matter to my attention in
issue 42: <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/42>.

* Version 1.6.0 on 2024-03-11
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f3311a84-ba62-4130-bb5a-2c5be694e494
:END:

This version adds some minor refinements and extends support for more
packages or faces.

** Support for the built-in ERC feature
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:fb8c9072-059e-40d2-859a-d4a2e1319e8e
:END:

The ~erc~ is one of the IRC clients built into Emacs. The other is
~rcirc~, which the Ef themes have supported for a long time.

All ERC buffers should now be consistent with the themes.

Note that in the interest of simplicity I am not covering the niche
feature of IRC to pass hardcoded colour values to some input. Those
will not be consistent with the themes and it is up to the user to
pick a legible colour combination (or, you know, just keep it simple).

** Better colours for the ~ztree~ package
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:856d4c3d-63c0-4d0d-80f8-fcc1e698d199
:END:

With ~ztree~ the user can check the differences between two
directories. All relevant colour-coding is now consistent with the Ef
themes and will use the palette mappings of the active theme.

** Support for the built-in ~window-divider-mode~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:61eb251e-5da9-4b8b-923f-03c365bc0f1e
:END:

This mode controls the style of window dividers. Those now are using a
grey value instead of the one applied to the main foreground. In other
words, they are more subtle.

** The ~highlight-indentation~ package is covered
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0d754e33-5c05-45e1-ac5f-12061e7f6728
:END:

Thanks to Oleksii (Alex) Koval for the contribution. This was done in
pull request 38: <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/38>.
The change is well below the ~15 line limit, meaning that Oleksii does
not need to assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation.

** Some active region background colours are a bit more prominent
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f1836222-afe6-478d-8cc7-bbf849c75066
:END:

The active region background colour of the ~ef-autumn~, ~ef-night~,
~ef-symbiosis~, and ~ef-tritanopia-dark~ themes is slightly more
noticeable now. Before is was too subtle and thus hard to spot in some
scenaria.

** An easier to spot magenta value for ~ef-tritanopia-dark~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:eff45ce7-d21c-42cf-8a89-19a656705925
:END:

Due to the requirements of blue-yellow colour deficiency (tritanomaly
or tritanopia), this theme uses a more restricted set of colours, with
carefully picked shades of magenta representing a neutral midpoint
between red and cyan. One of the magenta values that was used in many
parts of this theme is now recalibrated to better perform its function
as a third and finer accent in relevant interfaces.

** Refined colours for colour-coded backgrounds in dark themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:80c7b4b1-0b25-45a0-98bc-8d6c33b06170
:END:

In many interfaces the themes apply colour-coded styles to communicate
meaning. For example, in Dired buffers items that are flagged for
deletion have a red background while those that are merely selected
use a green hue (deuteranopia and tritanopia themes have different
colour-coding schemes). In almost all the dark Ef themes, the
applicable values are now slightly more intense to (i) better
complement the foreground they are combined with and (ii) perform
their intended function of providing visual feedback.

** The ~gnus-button~ face is no longer underlined
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8be4d951-3a2e-4e01-b0dd-dfec44d0d8a8
:END:

This is because it applies in places where an underline is either
misleadingly styled like a link or is the kind of extra emphasis we do
not need (one of my design principles is to avoid exaggerations).

** The ~message-separator~ has a less intense background
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0b184e13-d1c4-4b77-9717-10366f58c905
:END:

This is about the text found in message/email composition buffers that
separates the headers from the body and by default reads =--text
follows this line--=. Its grey background is more subtle now and
remains easy to spot without being needlessly intense.

** The ~org-document-info-keyword~ inherits ~ef-themes-fixed-pitch~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7ead15d9-ac66-4c41-a1d0-6ea99cb6dc84
:END:

This means that the text is rendered in a monospaced font if the user
option ~ef-themes-mixed-fonts~ is set to a non-nil value.

** Semantic mappings for terminals
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:006436a1-638c-4aa8-ac38-654a246eda3f
:END:

The Ef themes do not hardcode colour values. Instead, they define
named colours and semantic mappings. The latter are applied to all the
relevant faces. The user can thus override the palette to apply
changes across the supported packages. The manual explains the
technicalities.

To extend this facility, all Ef themes now include semantic mappings
that are used by terminals or anything that reads ANSI escape
sequences. Most users should not have to touch these, but those who
want to do it can either use the ~ef-themes-common-palette-overrides~
or the equivalent user option of each individual theme (e.g.
~ef-summer-palette-overrides~).

The commands ~ef-themes-preview-colors~ and ~ef-themes-preview-colors-current~
are relevant to identify the names of the mappings or colours
to-be-overridden.

** The code underpinning the ~ef-themes-heading~ user option is improved

Thanks to Gautier Ponsinet for porting the implementation from my
~modus-themes~ (I thought I had done it long ago). Gautier's
contribution was sent to me as a patch via email.

* Version 1.5.0 on 2024-01-11
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1f0bf8f2-8ed3-48d0-b6a8-725eccf579ff

** The new ~ef-arbutus~ and ~ef-rosa~ themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f3f15c45-a118-4c14-9be0-7973fe500503
:END:

The ~ef-arbutus~ theme combines red and green colours against a mild
light red-pink background. The announcement article contains
screenshots: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-12-29-ef-arbutus/>.

The ~ef-rosa~ theme has a deep dark red-brown background with a blend
of magenta and green foregrounds. Check the blog post for pictures:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-06-emacs-ef-rosa/>.

These two new entries bring the total count of the collection to 30.

Remember that you can set the user option ~ef-themes-to-toggle~ to two
themes in the collection and switch between them with the command
~ef-themes-toggle~. For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ef-themes-to-toggle '(ef-arbutus ef-rosa))
#+end_src

Otherwise, use the command ~ef-themes-load-random~ (call it with a
=C-u= prefix argument to limit the result to either dark or light
themes, else call it from Lisp, like =(ef-themes-load-random 'dark)=).

** Stopped the ~transient~ buffers from trying semantic key colouration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4a900d7b-4f46-48a2-9d9c-506d3080c554
:END:

In a recent version of =transient.el=, there is a new user option that
applies colour-coding to keys (e.g. we see those while using ~magit~):
~transient-semantic-coloring~. This option is enabled by default,
changing the previous style that was used as a reference for all my
designs.

The idea with such colour coding is to indicate when a key continues
to display the transient, exits with a given action, and the like. For
our purposes this interface cannot work:

- We need some place to teach users what each colour means, as there
  are no indicators of any sort to help them (whereas, say, in diff
  buffers we have the plus and minus signs).

- Not all hues are suitable for highlighting a single character. In
  light themes, for example, green and yellow colours are TERRIBLE
  choices for the requirements of this interface where the key must be
  clearly visible. But when we introduce multiple colours, each with
  their own meaning, we will not be able to avoid those hues.

- The style of key bindings is not limited to =transient.el=. We find
  them when we invoke =M-x=, do =M-x describe-bindings=, while using
  the ~which-key~ package, and many more. If we are to change how
  =transient.el= shows key bindings, then we have to retain the same
  visual cues for other contexts. Otherwise, everything is inconsistent.

- All themes must use the same colours to preserve the colour coding,
  thus removing an important aspect of their presentation.

- This whole paradigm does not work for themes that are optimised for
  users with colour deficiency, due to the reduced number of suitable
  hues. With deuteranopia, for example, we can only rely on yellow and
  blue: since yellow is not optimal for single key highlights against
  a light backdrop, blue is the only hue that works in such a context.

The ~ef-themes~ will not support this user option. All relevant faces
use the style of standard key bindings.

Themes can enforce user option values, but I have decided to change
the faces instead to better communicate my intent. If a user wants
semantic colouring, they can change the faces to whatever they like.

** The ~evil~ prompts now show the correct colours
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7eb0175d-1afa-48f4-b150-4c8cf55f31e5
:END:

While using ~evil-mode~, the ex prompts no longer use their generic
hardcoded red value. They take an appropriate colour from the active
Ef theme.

** The ~imenu-list~ package is now supported
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:10f4d49e-e07e-433b-97ec-f15b50e90a06
:END:

This package uses the built-in ~imenu~ infrastructure to produce a
sidebar with points of interest in the buffer. Those headings now use
the correct colour values.

Thanks to newhallroad for bringing this matter to my attention in
issue 35 on the GitHub mirror: <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/35>.

** The ~nerd-icons-completion~ package is covered
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:14d2e825-3666-4bda-a03f-4179aaa42a03
:END:

This package defines a single face for directories/folders. It looks
like all the other ~nerd-icons~ packages that use that icon, such as
~nerd-icons-dired~.

Thanks to Ryan Kaskel for the contribution:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/47379>. The change
is small. Ryan does not need to assign copyright to the Free Software
Foundation.

** Completed the coverage of the ~denote~ faces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:431a601e-80d2-49e7-b4ec-7e5cc6b9c1f8
:END:

The new style ensures better thematic consistency.

These faces are found in Dired buffers when ~denote-dired-mode~ is
enabled. Same for the default style of the backlinks buffer.

** Changed highlights to avoid conflating "flagged" and "trashed" emails
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:34d5ee9d-0447-4295-a325-41ac88aab783
:END:

This is for email clients such as ~mu4e~ and ~notmuch~. Flagged ad
trashed emails used to have the same colour, which was a problem when
the user would try to filter in such a way as to show both at the same
time.

Thanks to Adam Porter (GitHub user alphapapa) for bringing this matter
to my attention in issue 32 on the GitHub mirror:
<https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/32>.

** Support for more specialised faces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:61f67237-3303-4642-afea-7c1477efbb06
:END:

- ~blink-matching-paren-offscreen~ :: Defined in the built-in
  =simple.el= to highlight the matching parenthesis in the echo area
  when it is off screen (Emacs 30).

- ~mct-highlight-candidate~ :: Part of the ~mct~ package to highlight
  the currently selected completion candidate in the =*Completions*=
  buffer.

- ~shr-mark~ :: Used by the built-in ~shr~ library (Simple HTML
  Renderer) to highlight =<mark>= tags (Emacs 29).

** Expanded the semantic colour mappings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6f4566d2-8683-4edc-8749-3e4821bf8397
:END:

Each theme defines colours and then maps them to semantic constructs.
The idea is to not hardcode colour values, but to have an indirection
that enforces consistency, while keeping things flexible/customisable.
Users can override palette entries as explained in the manual:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes#h:4b923795-4b23-4345-81e5-d1c108a84b6a>.

New semantic colour mappings are:

- =bg-search-current= :: Background colour of the currently matched
  term of search interfaces, like ~isearch~.

- =bg-search-lazy= ::  This background is used in the same contexts as
  the above, but for matches other than the current one.

- =bg-search-replace= :: Background of the currently targeted
  replacement in ~query-replace~ operations or related.

- =bg-search-rx-group-{0..3}=, :: Backgrounds for regular expression
  groups, such as while using =M-x re-builder=.

- =bg-fringe= and =fg-fringe= :: Applies to the background of the
  fringe area in Emacs frames. By default, the Ef themes do not use a
  distinct background there, so this is for those who need it.

- =prose-table-formula= :: Used for formula entries in plain text
  tables, such as with Org, to distinguish them from the other
  contents of the table.

** Miscellaneous
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:945d2bbb-01ac-4829-a17b-81055f6951a7
:END:

- Used the updated ~modus-themes~ formula for the contrast tables of
  all the Ef themes (stored in the file =contrast-ratios.org= in the
  project's root directory).

  I made this change in commit =b410fcc= in the ~modus-themes~ repo.
  The idea is to avoid the use of the ~cl-loop~ and other =cl-=
  functions that we don't really need (and which also have their own
  mini language that I find hard to remember/use).

- Tweaked the value of a few accented backgrounds to better fit with
  each theme's style. These colours may not be spotted anywhere right
  now, but are nonetheless available to those who use palette
  overrides (run the command ~ef-themes-preview-colors~ or
  ~ef-themes-preview-colors-current~ to visualise them).

* Version 1.4.0 on 2023-10-26

** Experience the "Melissa" variants
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a62f2e19-ed30-46fb-8f06-2adb7c6fb54b
:END:

The ~ef-melissa-dark~ and ~ef-melissa-light~ are the new members of
the Ef themes collection. They form a pair of warmly coloured palettes
that have a strong emphasis on yellow hues against a soft background.
In my opinion, these themes (as well as the "Elea" and "Maris"
variants) are best used when environmental light is neither too
intense nor too dim.

The blog post where I announced these new themes and showed screen
shots of them: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-10-04-ef-melissa-dark-light/>.

Screen shots for the entire collection are available on my website:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

There now are 28 themes in the ~ef-themes~ package, covering a broad
range of preferences and needs. They all are highly legible (typically
well above the WCAG AA standard) and very customisable (consult their
manual).

** Use palette overrides instead of ~ef-themes-region~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6487eab7-f61b-4ec4-a7b4-bedf0a0445ce
:END:

The user option ~ef-themes-region~ is no more. It used to provide an
intense variant to the region highlight colour. I am discontinuing
this as the themes have a powerful mechanism of overriding any entry
in their palette, with the benefit of semantic colour mappings, to
affect the style of the theme.

Palette overrides exist for each theme, but also as a common variable,
with the former taking precedence. A theme-specific variable looks
like ~ef-summer-palette-overrides~ while the common variable is
~ef-themes-common-palette-overrides~. Preview palette entries with the
command ~ef-themes-preview-colors~ or ~ef-themes-preview-colors-current~.

The manual describes all the details, though here is a simple snippet
to change the region of all themes to an intense yellow colour with an
equally pronounced foreground (i.e. overriding the colour of any
underlying text):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Evaluate and then reload the theme for changes to take effect.  Use
;; the command `ef-themes-preview-colors' to discover the names of
;; palette entries to override/remap.
(setq ef-themes-common-palette-overrides
      '((bg-region bg-yellow-intense)
        (fg-region fg-intense)))
#+end_src

** Git commit messages have more refined warnings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:cff8106f-8be2-4427-8d16-72eda35b3fad
:END:

While composing a Git commit message with either the ~magit~ package
or the built-in ~vc-git~, the summary line can display text in a
different colour to denote that it exceeds a certain character limit.
Such a limit is a convention to keep logs readable, though it is not
an error per se.

The Ef themes used to apply a background to those warnings, though
they now use only a foreground. The reason is that the styles I have
picked are carefully designed to be unambiguous, without needing to
exaggerate their mutual differences.

** The ~breadcrumb~ package uses appropriate styles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:75b50e0f-d641-4065-a731-8615a1321b12
:END:

~breadcrumb~ is a new contribution by João Távora:
<https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/breadcrumb.html>. It displays
information about the context of the current code form or document
heading in either the mode line or the header line. The styles it uses
are now consistent with the aesthetics of each of the Ef themes.

** Theme metadata for new Emacs versions is as intended
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3d9b951f-ce5b-409e-9dc5-4324fed6fa5c
:END:

This is about the very definition of each theme item, in order to
support new features in Emacs where themes can specify the set they
belong to, as well as whether they are light or dark. The built-in
command that leverages this facility ~theme-choose-variant~. Though
users of the Ef themes may prefer the commands ~ef-themes-select~,
~ef-themes-toggle~ (if the user option ~ef-themes-to-toggle~ is
configured), ~ef-themes-load-random~, ~ef-themes-select-dark~,
~ef-themes-select-light~.

This is in response to Emacs bug#65468:
<https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=65468>. Thanks to Mauro
Aranda for bringing this matter to my attention.

** Try the aquatic "Maris" variants
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:9e0f79cf-9042-40ec-b1c9-7ebcb23706c5
:END:

The ~ef-maris-dark~ and ~ef-maris-light~ are a pair of themes with a
grey-blue background, combined with blue, cyan, and green accents.
Much like the "Elea" variants that were published in version 1.2.0 of
the ~ef-themes~, the "Maris" variants are optimal for those times
where environmental lighting is neither too bright nor too dim.

The blog post announcing and demonstrating the new themes:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-07-22-ef-maris-dark-light/>.

Screen shots for the entire collection here:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

There now are 26 themes in the ~ef-themes~ package, covering a broad
range of preferences and needs.  They all are highly legible and
customisable (consult their manual).

** Shortdoc has consistent typography
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:79404e2a-d497-4770-8924-c3c2559e51fd
:END:

The default built-in ~shortdoc~ face inherit the ~variable-pitch~
face, which renders the text in the buffer proportionately spaced.  To
me, this feels out of place.  If the user wants Help and related
ancillary material to be typeset thus, they can enable
~variable-pitch-mode~ (e.g. via a hook).

Thanks to Bruno Boal for pointing out that the Ef themes did not cover
Shortdoc.  The message was conveyed via a private channel and the
information is shared with permission.

** Key bindings in minibuffer prompts stand out
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6a9cfb9b-75b3-487f-ba88-5460d5f08840
:END:

Steve Molinor informed me about a case where a key binding was shown
as part of the minibuffer prompt.  For some Ef themes, the result was
suboptimal due to the proximity of the colours involved.  I made all
the requisite tweaks, such that key bindings in prompts will stand out
(always in accordance with the principle of avoiding exaggerations).
Affected themes are:

- ~ef-bio-theme~
- ~ef-deuteranopia-dark-theme~
- ~ef-duo-light-theme~
- ~ef-elea-dark-theme~
- ~ef-elea-light-theme~
- ~ef-frost-theme~
- ~ef-night-theme~

This was done in issue 24 on the GitHub mirror:
<https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/24>.

** The ~ace-window~ package is supported
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:eb046bd5-c89a-4a3c-aeaf-4d6441c22e0a
:END:

The ~ace-window~ package now uses colours that are aligned with the
active Ef theme.  This is mostly a stylistic consideration, except for
the deuteranopia- and tritanopia- optimised themes, where the hue
matters greatly.

** The Ef commands with completion use a "completion table"
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:257beca2-8a21-44bf-9e21-822a761f4376
:END:

[ This is for advanced users or developers. ]

Commands such as ~ef-themes-select~ and ~ef-themes-preview-colors~ use
the minibuffer to pick a theme among the collection.  In the past, the
set of candidates did not have any metadata associated with it, so
Emacs could not tell what it was completing against.

The collection is now annotated with the completion category ~theme~.
Packages that can use this data include ~consult~, ~embark~, and
~marginalia~, while the built-in ~completion-category-overrides~ may
be involved.  For example, one may define a custom annotation function
for Marginalia, such that the alignment of the doc strings is at
column 40 instead of the generic default (I do not add any alignment
at the theme level to keep it agnostic of the completion front-end).

** General refinements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:88d1103e-0e9a-4d52-b692-0714e37daf61
:END:

- The ~ef-elea-light~ theme's palette entry of ~bg-changed-refine~ is
  marginally toned down.  This makes it consistent with its context
  (e.g. in Ediff buffers).

- The ~ef-deuteranopia-light~ theme's palette entry of ~magenta-faint~
  is desaturated to fit better in its context.  The =M-x calendar= as
  well as Org agenda buffers that show weekends will now look more
  consistent.

- The ~ef-bio~ theme's semantic colour mapping of ~link-alt~ is
  further differentiated from ~link~.  The previous value could be
  conflated with that of ~link~ in Info buffers.

* Version 1.2.0 on 2023-06-30

** Enjoy the new "Elea" variants
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:2bf490b8-2331-4d8d-892f-81c80a6cc1ff
:END:

The ~ef-elea-light~ and ~ef-elea-dark~ take inspiration from olives
and olive trees.  Their background is noticeably more subdued than
that of other Ef themes, making Elea optimal for times where
environmental light is neither too high nor too low.

Blog post that announced the new themes and presented their screen
shots: <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-06-18-ef-elea-dark-light/>.

Those who like primarily green-tinted themes can also try ~ef-spring~
(light) and ~ef-bio~ (dark).

The ~ef-themes~ collection now consists of 24 items, covering a broad
range of preferences and legibility needs.  Each theme is tested
extensively for stylistic consistency, as well as overall
effectiveness across the full spectrum of interfaces encountered in
Emacs.

** Support for the ~avy~ package
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e950d855-b4f4-4306-966e-777577b6a995
:END:

The ~avy~ package is now fully supported by the themes.  This was not
a trivial task, due to Avy's unique requirement for sufficiently high
contrast between adjacent coloured background /in addition/ to the
goal of the themes for comfortably high contrast between each given
combination of foreground and background.  To make the task even more
demanding, we have to account for colour deficiency, as in the case of
the tritanopia-optimised themes: ~ef-tritanopia-light~,
~ef-tritanopia-dark~ (tritanopia is blue-yellow colour deficiency).

** Support for other Avy-like elements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f3b5b43d-890e-4bab-b471-da404dbefcfc
:END:

The ~corfu~ and ~vertico~ packages provide Avy-like commands to select
a candidate in their respective completion interface.  Those are now
fully supported, benefitting from the aforementioned work.

** Explicit support for ~which-key~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:59ae9cb3-ca1e-461c-b9d6-72b8f596a123
:END:

The popular ~which-key~ package was already implicitly supported by
the themes.  Its faces inherit from standard font-lock faces.  I
decided to add explicit support in order to override its overall
style, as its default is too busy, although it technically works.
This hints at the unseen, yet non-trivial, effort themes require to
avoid exaggerations (in short: when everything is emphasised, nothing
stands out; when something indicates a familiar element of the
interface, it must have an equally familiar styling to minimise
friction/uncertainty).

** Support for ~csv-mode~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8174c576-4d62-47e9-88e0-641c790db330
:END:

The ~csv-mode~ defines the face of a separator character for the
tabular entries.  Its colour should now be easier to spot.

** Revised the Git summary line
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:2fb45808-e218-4d79-ba42-4c07e8f8af3a
:END:

The colour of the Git commit summary line, both for Magit and VC, is
now drawn from each theme's semantic =info= colour, whereas before it
was another accent colour.  The reason for this change is to make the
summary line always contrast nicely with the overlong summary warning
(the warning is visible when the length of the summary exceeds the
specified limit (check each package's configurations)).

** Miscellaneous
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7e52eb4c-3bf4-4268-a697-421c4d7a5a0f
:END:

+ Completion annotations are not shown for yet-to-be-loaded Ef themes.
  This avoids errors in ~modus-themes-select~ and related commands
  that use minibuffer completion.  Thanks to Christopher League for
  the patch.  The change is small and falls within the limits of what
  is allowed without assigning copyright to the Free Software
  Foundation.  This case was discussed in issue 22 on the GitHub
  mirror: <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/22>.

+ The documentation of ~ef-themes-headings~ uses simpler list
  constructs.  There is no user-facing change.  Thanks to Eshel Yaron
  for the patch, which is within the boundaries of what is possible
  with copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/42030>.

+ The manual of the themes, as well as the =contrast-ratios.org= file
  that is part of the project's Git repository, are reviewed to

* Version 1.1.0 on 2023-06-08
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b2b71029-dbb2-4fef-9640-f1767ea8c1d9
:END:

This release introduces several minor refinements to the project,
while adding support for more third-party packages or built-in face
groups.

** Tabs have their own semantic colour mappings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6c23ad2b-2380-40d1-8c47-1ce68bf3a036
:END:

The Ef themes are designed to abstract away common patterns based on
the semantics of the elements involved.  For example, all strings in
programming modes use the =string= colour that each theme defines in
its palette.  This allows the themes to share the same code base yet
remain distinct from each other.

Colours used for ~tab-bar-mode~, ~tab-line-mode~, and related are now
part of this design.  The new semantic mappings are =bg-tab-bar=,
=bg-tab-current=, =bg-tab-other=.

[ A theme palette can have user-defined overrides (e.g. tweak the
  main background).  Consult the manual for the technicalities or
  contact me if there is any doubt. ]

** Added support for the ~centaur-tabs~ package
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ad42585e-dabf-4efd-af2a-e54c08f69bc1
:END:

The aforementioned semantic colours are applied to the faces of the
~centaur-tabs~.  Using it with the themes now works as expected,
instead of defaulting to its own dark background colour (a default
that doesn't work with most themes, anyway).

Thanks to Amo DelBello for bringing this matter to my attention in
issue 21 on the GitHub mirror: <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/21>.

** Covered the ~nerd-icons~, ~nerd-icons-dired~, ~nerd-icons-ibuffer~ packages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:2b4a40b8-7aa0-40dc-b370-48ed9a60e734
:END:

These are a new family of packages that are gaining traction in the
Emacs milieu (for instance, the ~doom-modeline~ now uses the Nerd
icons, which must be installed with =M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts=).

Their colours are now consistent with all the Ef themes.

** Tweaked the colouration of the ~all-the-icons~ glyphs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6ab59190-505b-4ab4-a7fe-950a40f587fd
:END:

I refined some of the colours in use to introduce greater variety and
amplify certain values while avoiding exaggerations.  In short, they
should look nice and pretty.

** The ~whitespace-mode~ indicators are much more subtle
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7bea24eb-54a7-49f0-899f-28e231c48eaa
:END:

The previous style involved the use of a dim grey background.  While
this is good to spot invisible characters quickly, it is bad for users
who want to run ~whitespace-mode~ at all times (e.g. for Python which
is space-sensitive).

We thus remove the backgrounds by default but provide the option to
reinstate them via palette overrides (as documented at length in the
manual).  To this end, we have new semantic colour mappings for
ordinary negative space and its invisible characters:

- =bg-space=
- =fg-space=
- =bg-space-err=

** Ediff faces no longer have an implicit dependency on diff-mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e5d24c78-b0d3-4926-9272-e5e96d584e3e
:END:

I made a mistake where the Ediff faces would inherit the styles of
their ~diff-mode~ counterparts.  This usually works, such as when
~ediff~ is invoked from ~magit~, though it will not do the right thing
if the user invokes some Ediff command directly without first loading
~diff-mode~.

This no longer happens.  Ediff always works.  Stylistically,
everything looks the same.

** The ~git-gutter~ and ~git-gutter-fr~ packages are supported
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b8dd12ff-27a5-4182-bc01-ea2293769de5
:END:

These now use the appropriate colours defined by the Ef themes.  This
is especially important for themese that do not use the generic
red-green colour coding scheme.

** image-dired marked items are easier to spot
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3ea60dda-5cd6-4918-9dd3-4f3caaa3aa62
:END:

With ~image-dired~ the user can apply selection or deletion marks to
image thumbnails.  Those marks are colour-coded the same way they are
in Dired (the exact hues depend on the theme to account for
accessibility, e.g. for deuteranopia or tritanopia).  Sometimes the
colour of the mark is obscured by the same colour found in the
thumbnail.  To make the mark stand out, a border is drawn around it,
making the selection unambiguous.

** Holidays and diary entries are more distinct and have no background
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:02699fbb-1b31-4116-84e6-387bf27bf658
:END:

The holidays and diary entries that are found in the =M-x calendar= or
=M-x diary= buffers no longer use a subtle background colour.  The old
design was not consistent with similar patterns established by the
themes, such as how a date/timestamp should be represented.

Furthermore, the given constructs are assigned to contrasting hues to
stand apart from each other and also be easy spot in their context
(especially holidays in the Calendar view).

** The ~mood-line~ is covered by the themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:d16978a0-3112-4df7-85d4-344010f2027d
:END:

This is a package that refashions the Emacs mode line.  It is
conceptually similar to the ~doom-modeline~.

** Miscellaneous
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:caae4b9d-fb03-4a04-a476-6993763eecbc
:END:

- Added links in the Custom User Interface to the ~ef-themes~ web
  pages for the manual and sample pictures, respectively.  Those links
  are visible when perusing the various =M-x customize= buffers where
  entries related to the Ef themes are present.

- Made ~ef-themes--load-theme~ return the =THEME= argument it operates
  on.  The intent is to allow other functions that call this one to
  capture the return value for their purposes.

- Extended support for the built-in ERT faces, which are used in
  regression tests of Emacs Lisp code.

* Version 1.0.0 on 2023-05-16
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3ea1104e-6aad-4add-91b1-055776a24ef9
:END:

This is the first major release of the ~ef-themes~.  The project is in
a stable state.  I continue to make refinements to it, especially for
the sort of details that are hard to spot.

** Try the two new themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ad61985a-1bdb-425f-a615-ed036f9f7abb
:END:

The ~ef-kassio~ and ~ef-symbiosis~ provide yet more stylistic
variation to an already wide collection:

- ~ef-kassio~ is a light theme that harmoniously combines blue and red
  hues in an overall design that feels earthly and measured.  Its name
  is a cryptic reference to a place in Greece.

- ~ef-symbiosis~ is a dark theme that balances contrasting cool and
  warm hues.  Deep and lighter browns blend with vivid greens and
  neutral blues.  The name of the theme is a reference to the
  coexistence of hues that could belong to two separate themes, yet
  feel natural in tandem.

Picture of all the themes: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

** Commands to switch between only dark or light themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:26279724-ed70-4fc8-a432-e1a01c6c7835
:END:

The ~ef-themes-select-dark~ and ~ef-themes-select-light~ provide
minibuffer completion that limits the candidates to the respective
subset.  This makes it easier for users to discover another theme they
may like.

** Helpful completion annotations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a3ef5b3f-686f-4295-92d0-96cffeaa0e9f
:END:

All Ef commands that use minibuffer completion now produce annotations
that describe in a few words what each theme is about.  For example,
~ef-deuteranopia-dark~ is presented as a "Legible dark theme,
optimized for red-green color deficiency".

** Palette overrides
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5f150190-ab94-40b8-a6ec-f787173330f3
:END:

All variables that allow the user to override named colours and
semantic colour mappings are now declared as user options.
Concretely, these can now be discovered from the Custom interface.

Palette overrides are not new to this version, though they are
henceforth considered stable for widespread use.  Consult the manual
for how to make use of them and how to preview the entries of any
given theme palette.

To ensure consistency, some symbols in the palette have been renamed.
For example, graph colours follow the pattern ~bg-graph-red-0~ instead
of ~red-graph-0-bg~.  Same for intensely coloured backgrounds, which
are now named like ~bg-red-intense~ rather than ~bg-red~.

** Improved graph colours
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f4dd0c13-a3cb-4d7e-ac7e-82ed1b734979
:END:

All themes have a refined palette subset for graph-related purposes.
These are encountered, for example, in the ~org-habit~ consistency
graph.  The differences are subtle, yet important in context to
improve the usability of the given interfaces.

** Improved graph colours for deuteranopia, tritanopia
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ddd9bffa-52d4-4325-9050-b9bbd91b984e
:END:

I also recalibrated the graph-related colours for the deuteranopia-
and tritanopia- optimized themes.  This is related to the above, but I
am writing it separately as it has its own requirements.

The default design of ~org-habit~ expects a colour coding of red,
yellow, green, blue.  This cannot work for users with either red-green
or blue-yellow colour deficiency.  The relevant Ef themes have long
accounted for this requirement, though they now are even better at it.

** Support for new faces and changes to existing ones
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:fd57dbdc-9439-4426-a757-25797e20bfd2
:END:

- Newly supported packages are: ~jinx~, ~rst-mode~, ~vundo~, ~vterm~.
  Consult the manual for the full list of supported packages.  Some
  packages are implicitly covered, because they have reasonable
  defaults, such as my ~sxhkdrc-mode~.

- The built-in ~menu~, ~scroll-bar~, and ~tool-bar~ faces are now
  covered.  These only come into effect in certain scenaria, such as
  an Emacs build done with the Lucid toolkit or a text session that
  involves usage of the menu bar.

- The built-in ~flymake~ linter has several new faces in Emacs 29 and
  Emacs 30, which are now fully supported by the themes and styled in
  the interest of harmony (~flymake~ is available from GNU ELPA for
  those who want to benefit from the latest features in older versions
  of Emacs).

- The built-in ~proced~ has several new faces.  All are supported,
  adding optional extra colour to those buffers without overdoing it.

- Org mode has a new ~org-agenda-calendar-daterange~ face.  It is
  covered and there also are semantic colour mappings for date ranges.

- Clickable buttons, such as in Custom buffers, are now shown with a
  three-dimensional effect.  The flat style creates ambiguity between
  the button and the text fields.  This happens, for example, with
  =M-x customize-variable= for ~org-capture-templates~ which has lots
  of button and text field combinations.  The added sense of depth
  helps with the usability of these buttons because it makes them
  unambiguous.

- All relevant faces correspond to the semantic colour mappings for
  ~prose-code~ and ~prose-verbatim~ (useful for palette overrides).

* Version 0.11.0 on 2023-03-13
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:be78917e-04b6-4958-a95c-848aa6fa279c
:END:

** New options to override the colour palette
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:9762796a-81d0-4881-a6cb-e7f1260afa23
:END:

It is now possible to tweak the colour values of each theme's palette
and to change how named colours are mapped to semantic constructs.
Concretely, each theme's palette consists of two subsets: (i) named
colours that associate an arbitrary symbol, like =blue-warmer= to a
colour value such as =#5250ef=, and (ii) semantic colour mappings that
assign a named colour to constructs like =date-weekend=.

[ For a video demo of the same idea that I implemented in the
  ~modus-themes~, check /mutatis mutandis/:
  https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-12-17-modus-themes-v4-demo/. ]

The feature is not as fully fledged as in my ~modus-themes~ because
the latter have a broader scope than the ~ef-themes~.  Still, it is
comprehensive and will likely cover the needs of users who want to
tinker with colours.

** The "preview palette" commands have new aliases
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:73465a48-bce1-4751-a2e1-e8c9cb830dc3
:END:

The command ~ef-themes-preview-colors~ can now also be called with
~ef-themes-list-colors~.  Same for ~ef-themes-preview-colors-current~
which is also known as ~ef-themes-list-colors-current~.

These new names make it easier to "preview" or "list" the given
palette entries.

** Palette preview commands can show semantic colour mappings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a9e984b8-89ee-48d3-9449-be07c864b148
:END:

When called with a prefix argument (=C-u= with default key bindings),
the commands ~ef-themes-preview-colors~, ~ef-themes-preview-colors-current~
will produce a buffer with the mappings specified in the given palette
and in user-defined overrides.  Whereas their normal behaviour without
the prefix argument is to list all the named colours.

In this context, "named colours" are associations between a symbol and
a colour value like =(blue-warmer "#5250ef")=, whereas "semantic
colour mappings" describe associations between an abstract construct
of the interface and a named colour, such as =(variable blue-warmer)=.

** Automatically disable other themes when loading an Ef theme
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:49e1285d-2659-413b-8dee-9a057dc83dc8
:END:

The user option ~ef-themes-disable-other-themes~ makes the commands
that load an Ef theme run ~disable-theme~ on anything that is not part
of the collection.  These commands are ~ef-themes-select~,
~ef-themes-toggle~, ~ef-themes-load-random~.

The user option is enabled by default.  The reason is that Emacs will
blithely blend multiple themes that a user loads, leading to a design
that ranges from mildly annoying to outright unusable.  It is a bad
default behaviour that hinders accessibility.

Expert users who know what they are doing when blending themes can
simply disable this user option (or not use the Ef commands for
loading a theme).

** Stylistic changes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6d601455-7ca7-414d-b3fd-8608a2705f09
:END:

*** Refined deuteranopia warning colours
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:33a54098-b884-4e29-a7e2-3407d81a9657
:END:

[ "Deuteranopia" is the technical term for red-green colour deficiency. ]

This concerns the themes ~ef-deuteranopia-dark~ and
~ef-deuteranopia-light~.  The slightly adjusted colours help further
differentiate certain constructs in various contexts, such as the Org
agenda buffer where =SCHEDULED= and =DEADLINE= items need to be told
apart.

*** Implemented appropriate colour-coded foregrounds in Magit/diff-mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1840766d-a047-4c7d-88e0-5a94497a32d9
:END:

~diff-mode~ and Magit diff buffers now affect the text colour of the
added/removed/changed lines to improve their usability.  Before, the
combination was of a colour-coded background with the main foreground,
which could make it a bit harder to track lines.

*** Removed the bold weight from Magit diff hunk headings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:740c12ec-e4d5-4603-8ada-cecfa2337548
:END:

Inactive diff hunk headings do not need to be bold, as they are
already easy to tell apart from their context.  The added bold is
useful for the currently selected diff hunk, as it draws attention to
it.

*** Revised all mail-related semantic colour mappings
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:fa172499-9d84-4fe5-8a24-53c5d5d26a0c
:END:

Buffers such as those of viewing messages with Notmuch, Mu4e, Gnus
have more appropriate colour combinations in the interest of avoiding
exaggerations.  Same for the message composition buffers (e.g. what we
get with the ~compose-mail~ command and its email-client-specific
counterparts).

*** The background of Notmuch message headers is more noticeable
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7d08186c-56a1-417d-bda9-29cb75dbbcd0
:END:

The ~notmuch~ email client for Emacs has a thread-based view of
messages where each email starts with its own header.  The slightly
more noticeable background makes it easier to discern where a new
message starts.

*** Added support for the powerline package
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6ab392cc-ffe9-4e7e-98a1-5c409ea3a03e
:END:

I added support for this package because other packages depend on it.
Note though that I have encountered visual glitches with ~powerline~.
Those occur while switching themes and require a re-run of the
Powerline setup with =M-x powerline-reset=.

*** Removed the background colour from ~consult~ lines
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:af3dfe52-d639-4be5-9d38-47960c0cdc0e
:END:

The default value of ~consult-line-number-prefix~ inherits from the
~line-number~ face.  The Ef themes make the latter inherit from
~default~ in order to have the lines increase/decrease in font size
when the user calls the ~text-scale-adjust~ command.  This arrangement
meant that Consult was implicitly getting the main background which
caused commands like ~consult-line~ to not be highlighted from their
absolute beginning but only after the line number.

Thanks to Daniel Mendler for bringing this matter to my attention:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3Cb03413a6-cb77-615d-145d-db4eb710bfca%40daniel-mendler.de%3E>.

*** Defined ~consult-file~ to look the same as file names in Grep buffers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5986048b-c986-47ac-b245-604576d6a206
:END:

This face is used when the user option ~vertico-group-format~ is set
to nil.  With this change, we keep things consistent in the common
workflow of using ~consult-grep~ and exporting to a grep buffer via
~embark-export~.  The packages involved are ~vertico~, ~consult~,
~embark~.

*** Made ~eglot-diagnostic-tag-unnecessary-face~ a warning
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3ac315a8-dbf6-42a3-8d5f-004ebee5b5fb
:END:

By default it inherits the ~shadow~ face, which makes it
counter-intuitive as it dims the text instead of bringing it to our
attention.  The intent of ~eglot-diagnostic-tag-unnecessary-face~ is
to highlight unused symbols, so this is better presented as an
informational warning.

Thanks to Augusto Stoffel for bringing this matter to my attention.
This was done via a private channel and the information is shared with
permission.

*** Configured ~dashboard~ icons to retain their underlying colour
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:966dcdfe-35a0-4d27-b247-776d7b33c974
:END:

The default value of the ~dashboard-items-face~ made all icons use the
same colour, detracting from their distinctiveness.  Thanks to Thanos
Apollo for bringing this matter to my attention.  It was done via a
private channel and the information is shared with permission.

*** Removed the bold weight from Org agenda deadline/scheduled
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6c4f8194-9e1b-45ad-8111-1e056af5a98c
:END:

This makes agenda buffers less noisy.  The original intent was to
differentiate current/imminent from past/future items, though I feel
that was the wrong design.  We first want to deal with current tasks
and do not want to feel overwhelmed by the design.

*** Removed the bold weight from regular expression constructs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1bd90c6d-e5bd-45c1-9a65-7ed0a59abc7d
:END:

This was used for escaped parentheses and the like.  It was making
certain strings harder to read, such as:

#+begin_example
"\\(?:\\.\\(?:m\\(?:kv\\|p4\\)\\|ogg\\|webm\\)\\)"
#+end_example

*** Retrieve any colour value from the palette
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b5f75284-36fa-49e4-a571-44d4430933be
:END:

[ This is for do-it-yourself users who need to apply colours in custom
  code they maintain.  As such, it is a bit technical.  Skip to the
  next heading if you are not such a user. ]

The fuction ~ef-themes-get-color-value~ can be called from Lisp to
return the value of a color from the active Ef theme palette.  It
takea a =COLOR= argument and an optional =OVERRIDES=.

=COLOR= is a symbol that represents a named color entry in the
palette.

<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes#h:8dd67bf5-879e-46e5-b277-5bac141f53d1>

If the value is the name of another color entry in the palette (so a
mapping), this function recurs until it finds the underlying color
value.

With an optional =OVERRIDES= argument as a non-nil value, it accounts
for palette overrides.  Else it reads only the default palette.

<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes#h:4b923795-4b23-4345-81e5-d1c108a84b6a>

With optional =THEME= as a symbol among ~ef-themes-collection~, use
the palette of that item.  Else use the current Ef theme.

If =COLOR= is not present in the palette, this function returns the
=unspecified= symbol, which is safe when used as a face attribute's
value.

An example with ~ef-summer~ to show how this function behaves
with/without overrides and when recursive mappings are introduced.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Here we show the recursion of palette mappings.  In general, it is
;; better for the user to specify named colors to avoid possible
;; confusion with their configuration, though those still work as
;; expected.
(setq ef-themes-common-palette-overrides
      '((cursor red)
        (prompt cursor)
        (variable prompt)))

;; Ignore the overrides and get the original value.
(ef-themes-get-color-value 'variable)
;; =>
 "#5250ef"

;; Read from the overrides and deal with any recursion to find the
;; underlying value.
(ef-themes-get-color-value 'variable :overrides)
;; => "#d3303a"
#+end_src

  enhancement.

* Version 0.10.0 on 2022-12-02
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:763e6cf6-78b4-43a0-a582-7b00ce9210cc

** New user option for highlighted region
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4ff356d1-5aad-442c-9dcc-08b78d985714
:END:

The ~ef-themes-region~ accepts a list of symbols that affect how the
region looks.  The manual or the variable's doc string describe the
technicalities.  Here is a sample:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ef-themes-region '(intense no-extend))
#+end_src

Remember that changes to theme user options must be done before
loading a theme.  For any subsequent customisation, a theme re-load is
required.

** The ~ef-themes-headings~ now affects the Org agenda
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e9e5fec6-9566-4b47-be05-ec82dccca7c4
:END:

Before, the Org agenda headings would inherit from the generic heading
levels 0 and 1.  This had undesired effects, as users often need a
taller typeface for prose (e.g. regular Org files), though not
necessarily for viewing their already well-structured Org agenda.

The ~ef-themes-headings~ can now control the Org agenda date and
structure headings directly.  A complete example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ef-themes-headings ; read the manual's entry or the doc string
      '((0 . (variable-pitch light 1.9))
        (1 . (variable-pitch light 1.8))
        (2 . (variable-pitch light 1.7))
        (3 . (variable-pitch semilight 1.6))
        (4 . (variable-pitch semilight 1.5))
        (5 . (variable-pitch regular 1.4))
        (6 . (variable-pitch regular 1.3))
        (7 . (variable-pitch 1.2))    ; absence of weight means `bold'
        (agenda-date . (semilight 1.5))
        (agenda-structure . (variable-pitch light 1.9))
        (t . (variable-pitch 1.1))))
#+end_src

In Org agenda buffers, the "structure" is the type of heading that
describes the current block of content.  In the generic agenda, it is
the first line, which reads something like =Week-agenda (W48):=.

Note that Org re-uses heading levels past 8.  This is not the theme's
work, so heading 9 looks the same as 1.  Check the user options
~org-level-faces~, ~org-n-level-faces~ for ways to change this.

** Lots of small tweaks to colour values
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:55a1f31f-e99c-463d-8646-dbad95e5279e
:END:

All themes have enjoyed attention to their details.  The general idea
is that some colours are fine-tuned to look better in their context.
In most cases, the change is subtle and can only be noticed when
comparing samples side-by-side.  Some more noticeable effects:

+ All neutral backgrounds that are used for elements such as the
  ~tab-bar-mode~, the ~header-line~, the mode lines, and the like, are
  all amplified.  They should now be easier to discern, especially on
  monitors with inaccurate reproduction of grey values.

+ The ~match~ face, which is used by Grep, Occur, and related, now
  uses a coloured background instead of a neutral grey.  This makes it
  easier to stand out.  The choice of colour is consistent with the
  backgrounds used by Isearch for the current and other matches: they
  do not clash (e.g. a user may perform a search inside an Occur
  buffer).

+ The =M-x calendar= weekdays and weekends are rendered in distinct
  colours.  Weekends stand out the same way they do in physical
  calendars and common apps.

+ The Org agenda date headings follow the same style as those of the
  =M-x calendar=.  THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL in the hope of receiving
  feedback about weekends standing out.  If the community thinks the
  effect is inappropriate, I will revert this change or, anyhow, adapt
  accordingly.  Though please give it a fair chance.

+ Magit diff hunk headings now use more appropriate shades of grey.
  The active/current diff hunk heading stands out better, while
  inactive hunk headings are distinguishable from the diff's context.

+ Git/VC commit hashes have a tinted foreground instead of a dim grey.
  They are thus easier to spot in various contexts, such as Magit
  rebase operations and =M-x vc-print-root-log=.

+ The yellow used for strings in the ~ef-cherie~ theme is now a bit
  more gold.  This helps strings stand out when placed beside
  functions.

+ The ~ef-night~ heading 4 no longer uses the same red as that of the
  =TODO= Org keyword.  The previous design was a mistake on my part.
  Heading levels 6 and 8 are tweaked accordingly.

+ The heading level 6 of ~ef-summer~ and ~ef-spring~ are also
  disambiguated from Org's =TODO=, while retaining their character.

  Emacs whether the theme is light or dark and the family it belongs

* Version 0.9.0 on 2022-10-28

** Introduced the 'ef-cherie' and 'ef-cyprus' themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:877fc5ae-d48d-4f0c-80bf-248501f284eb
:END:

~ef-cherie~ is a dark theme with mostly pink, magenta, and gold
colours.  ~ef-cyprus~ is a light theme characterised by green, yellow,
teal, and red colours.

Read the announcements, which also include screen shots:

+ <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-25-ef-cherie/>.
+ <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-24-ef-cyprus-theme/>.

These themes bring the total number of the collection to 20, split
into an equal number of light and dark themes.

Note that some themes in the collection are designed as pairs.  Those
have =-light= or =-dark= in their name.  The others are standalone.
Regardless, the user can specify any two themes in the value of the
user option ~ef-themes-to-toggle~ and then switch between them with
the command ~ef-themes-toggle~.  Or just use the other available
commands: ~ef-themes-select~ for minibuffer completion and the
~ef-themes-load-random~ to load one from the collection (with a =C-u=
prefix argument to limit the set to light or dark themes). The
official manual explains more.

Will there be more themes?  Time will tell.  Though I think that
between those and the =modus-themes=, I have covered a very broad
range of preferences and requirements for accessibility.

** The 'ef-themes-select' optionally limits to light or dark
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:caeb1c99-8890-4275-b812-45d5715d071b
:END:

The command ~ef-themes-select~ can now accept a prefix argument (=C-u=
with the default key bindings).  It prompts for a selection between
light or dark themes and then uses minibuffer completion that only
includes the items of the given set.

Inspect the value of the variables ~ef-themes-dark-themes~,
~ef-themes-light-themes~ for what is included in each set.

[ Note that the command ~ef-themes-load-random~ has the same behaviour
  of limiting to a set when it reads a prefix argument. ]

** The 'ef-themes-load-random' reports the theme it loaded
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:308296a7-46f8-4524-8c62-9ad720f5fb3d
:END:

The command ~ef-themes-load-random~ has received a quality-of-life
improvement to its functionality.  It now prints a message in the echo
area that includes the name of the theme it loaded.  The user can
review echo area messages by invoking the ~view-echo-area-messages~
command, which is bound to =C-h e= by default.

This change makes it easier for the user to remember a theme they
liked.

Thanks to Federico Stilman for sharing with me the idea of reporting
the name of the randomly loaded theme.  This information is shared
with permission, as it was done via a private channel.

** Stylistic refinements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a9155853-90c1-40a6-8d20-5756cbcdda8f
:END:

+ All themes have palette entries for colour-coded underlines.  Those
  are used by packages like =flymake= and =flyspell= to highlight
  errors and warnings.  All dark Ef themes had a bit too intense
  colours applied to those constructs.  These have now been toned down
  in order to avoid potential distractions.  They still perform their
  intended function, without drawing too much attention to themselves.

+ Almost all themes have a slightly more pronounced =border= colour.
  This is used to underline links and to draw the vertical line that
  separates Emacs windows (among others).  It still is a subtle grey,
  though it works better than before.

+ The =warning= mapping of many themes has been revised to be a more
  neutral yellow (I define hues as triplets of neutral, warmer,
  colder).  The previous style was a warmer shade of yellow, which
  brought it closer to red.  This, in turn, had the unintended effect
  of making the Org agenda potentially confusing.

+ The =mail-3= mapping of some themes has been tweaked to better stand
  out in its context, without prejudice to the overall character of
  its theme.  This colour is used by email clients that leverage the
  built-in =message.el= library (such as Gnus, Mu4e, Notmuch).  In
  short, if you edit messages with deeply nested quotes, you will have
  an easier time telling apart those inner levels.

** Support for packages, face groups, or faces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:37e5dd08-ba21-4847-b14d-5aea9046168e
:END:

+ auto-dim-other-buffers :: Added support for this package.  It
  applies a grey background to inactive windows.
+ consult-separator :: This is the border that divides previews of
  registers when the user evaluates the following form and then
  invokes C-x r i: ~(advice-add #'register-preview :override
  #'consult-register-window)~
+ embark-collect-zebra-highlight :: The default value of this face is
  technically okay, though it is a neutral grey which does not look
  right with some of the Ef themes.
+ flycheck :: Added support for this package and covered all its
  faces.  It looks like ~flymake~ as it leverages the same set of
  colour-coding that the themes define.
+ flymake :: Expanded support to its fringe indicators.  Those are
  bitmaps that bring attention to in-buffer colour-coded underlines.
  They use an appropriate colour coding, like errors being red
  (depending on the theme---see the deuteranopia and tritanopia
  implementations).
+ help-key-binding :: This face is now rendered in ~fixed-pitch~
  (monospaced font) when the user option ~ef-themes-mixed-fonts~ is
  non-nil.  This user option basically makes spacing-sensitive
  constructs retain their mono spacing, while all the rest can use a
  proportionately spaced font (e.g. enable ~variable-pitch-mode~ in
  Org buffers to see the effect---changes to theme user options
  require a theme reload).
+ ibuffer :: Added support for this built-in package.  Its marks look
  the same as those of Dired.
+ image-dired :: Expanded support to two new faces it has for the
  ~header-line~.  Those are part of Emacs 29.
+ mm-command-output :: This is a built-in face we encounter on
  occasion in Gnus buffers.
+ olivetti :: Made its ~olivetti-fringe~ face invisible.  We do not
  want to see the fringes when we enter ~olivetti-mode~ (it centres
  the contents of the buffer).  Note that the Ef themes do not have
  visible fringes, anyway, though a user may tweak the ~fringe~ face
  in their local setup.
+ org-agenda-current-time :: Made this face use the main foreground
  colour.  It applies to the line that shows the current time in
  today's Org agend time grid.  The previous mapping to =variable= was
  giving us decent results, though this was a matter of serendipity:
  there is a chance that a theme maps an inappropriate colour to
  =variable= (e.g. red, which will interfere with deadlines).  This
  new design is just as legible, while it has the upside of reducing
  colouration where it is not needed, letting other elements get the
  attention they deserve.
+ trashed :: Added support for this package.  It marks lines like
  Dired and follows the same stylistic patterns.  Unlike Dired, it has
  an extra "mark" type (select, delete, restore), which uses
  appropriate colouration.
+ tty-menu :: This is the set of faces that are used in a text
  terminal when the ~menu-bar-mode~ is enabled and the user interacts
  with it via the command ~menu-bar-open~.  Note, however, that the Ef
  themes are meant to be used either in a graphical Emacs frame or in
  a text terminal with very good support for colour reproduction.
  The themes do not look good in a generic terminal.
+ writegood-mode :: Added support for this package.  Its style is
  consistent with ~flyspell~ as it uses the same colour-coding scheme.

** Faces defined by the Ef themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3ade9d4b-858d-4e28-85c4-0cddf046f4ce
:END:

The themes define some faces to make it possible to achieve
consistency between various groups of faces.  For example, all "marks
for selection" use the ~ef-themes-mark-select~ face.  If, say, the
user wants to edit this face to include an underline, the change will
apply to lots of packages, like Dired, Trashed, Ibuffer.

All the faces defined by the themes:

+ ~ef-themes-fixed-pitch~
+ ~ef-themes-heading-0~
+ ~ef-themes-heading-1~

** Introduced themes for tritanopia
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:2ddca7b3-92d7-4bb8-a0f4-03e41d8bdfd6
:END:

The ~ef-tritanopia-dark~ and ~ef-tritanopia-light~ are optimised to
use red and cyan hues consistently throughout all interfaces.  This
means that users with blue-yellow colour deficiency or blindness are
empowered to use Emacs without compromising on usability.

Read the announcement:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-11-ef-themes-tritanopia/>.

These two themes complement what I already provide for users with
red-green colour deficiency (deuteranopia): ~ef-deuteranopia-dark~,
~ef-deuteranopia-light~.  Together with the rest of the set (and my
=modus-themes=), they cover a broad spectrum of preferences and needs
for legibility.

The deuteranopia or tritanopia themes can be used by anyone, simply on
the basis of their aesthetics: they look fine and work well (when I
develop a theme, I use it full-time).

** Bespoke colours for underlines
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:31a6d165-5ee7-4f9d-bbb6-d27c9bb82e52
:END:

Each theme has a new subset of colours which are optimised for
colour-coded underlines.  Think about spell checking and code linting.
These colours are specific to each theme's requirements so that, for
example, deueteranopia does not use red and green, while tritanopia
does not rely on yellow and blue.

** Support for new packages or face groups
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4864aa6c-eb9b-4600-8b5e-6533a000b140

** Tweaks to already supported faces

:END:

+ The tagging operations of =notmuch= which underline added tags and
  strike through deleted ones, now use the new colours for underlines.
  The effect is small, but still constitutes an improvement.

+ The background colour of the =company= popup is a bit lighter than
  before.  This helps the foreground colours be easier to discern.  It
  also makes it look consistent with =corfu=.

This is not a "change log" per se, but it is worth mentioning.  A few
days ago I was informed of a post on Reddit asking something related
to my themes.  Please understand that I cannot go around the Internet
hoping to provide tech support.  Each project of mine has a mailing
list and two (!) mirrors on GitHub and GitLab.  All are actively
maintained and supported.  In addition, you are always welcome to
email me directly.  I reply in a timely fashion and in full (check the
mailing lists and issue trackers, if you have any doubt).  What I will
not do is go searching for you on random websites.

* Version 0.7.0 on 2022-10-08

** Introduced the ~ef-bio~ and ~ef-frost~ themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b2731515-50d0-4502-8d63-1c99a3474bfc
:END:

These two new themes bring the total count to 16.

+ ~ef-bio~ is a dark theme with green, teal, blue, and purple colours.
  Read the announcement, which also includes screen shots:
  <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-02-ef-themes-bio-theme/>.

+ ~ef-frost~ is a light theme with blue, cyan, teal, and purple
  colours.  Check the announcement on my website (with screenshots):
  <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-10-03-ef-themes-frost-theme/>.

You may have noticed that some themes in this collection have a
=-dark= or =-light= suffix in their name.  This means that they are
stylistically close to each other (NOT identical colour mappings
though).  For example the ~ef-trio-dark~ and ~ef-trio-light~ follow
the same idea of using three main hues across almost all interfaces
(magenta, blue, teal).  Whereas all other themes are designed to stand
on their own and have no obvious counterpart.  Nevertheless, one can
pick whichever two themes they prefer to switch between.  Refer to the
user option ~ef-themes-to-toggle~ and then invoke the command
~ef-themes-toggle~.  Else use the command ~ef-themes-load-random~,
optionally with a prefix argument (=C-u=) to limit the choice to dark
or light themes.

Thanks to Sven Seebeck for reminding me to register the ~ef-frost~ as
part of the collection.  I forgot to do it the day I published the
theme.  This information is shared with permission, as it was done via
a private channel.

** General refinements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:2093bc64-1d42-472a-86ba-1de71a5316f2
:END:

+ Changed the dates in ~org-agenda~ buffers to use the same style as
  headings level 1 instead of 3.  This ensures that they are always
  sufficiently distinct from the title of the agenda structure (there
  can be many titles for those who use block agendas).  In the agenda,
  the block titles use the equivalent of the Org =#+title= construct,
  i.e. heading level 0.

  The style of all heading levels is subject to the user option
  ~ef-themes-headings~: it affects their height, weight, and whether
  they have a proportionately spaced font, on a per-level basis.

+ Tweaked the background colour which is used by Org (among others) to
  highlight the calculated date in its relevant prompts or when
  rescheduling an item in the agenda.  The changes are subtle in most
  cases, with the intent to make the colour fit better with the rest
  of the theme.

  This background is also used to highlight in its original context an
  Org source block that is shown in its own buffer following the use
  of =C-c '= (~org-edit-special~).

+ Adjusted the style of the filter that is used in the header of Org
  agenda searches.  It now always complements the rest of the text on
  that line.  To understand what I am referring to, do =M-x
  org-agenda=, then type =s=, and search for, say, =TODO=.  In the
  resulting buffer, the header reads: =Search words: TODO=.  The final
  part is this filter.

+ Changed the applicable colours of ~org-agenda-clocking~ to use a
  combination of yellow foreground and yellow-tinted background.  This
  face is used to highlight in the agenda the currently clocked in
  task.  The element is easier to spot, without being too intense.

+ Reduced the overall colouration in the ~vc-dir~ buffer.  It should
  now look appropriate across all the Ef themes, while remaining
  usable.

+ Aligned the style of the ~gnus-summary-low-unread~ face with that of
  all the other "low" scoring messages to use italicised fonts (by
  inheriting from the ~italic~ face).

+ Added support for the ~log-edit-headers-separator~ (which I added to
  Emacs 29) and ~child-frame-border~ (Emacs 28) faces.  They basically
  add an appropriately coloured border in relevant contexts.

+ Removed the background colour from the ~line-number-major-tick~,
  ~line-number-minor-tick~ faces.  These are used by the
  ~display-line-numbers-mode~ with something like:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq display-line-numbers-major-tick 20
        display-line-numbers-minor-tick 5)
  #+end_src

+ Wrote a Do-It-Yourself guide to make the style of the mode lines
  emulate the default of my =modus-themes=: shades of grey with a
  border around them.

+ Answered a frequently asked question about the availability of too
  many options.  In short: pick ~ef-light~ and/or ~ef-dark~ and take
  it slow.

+ Finally, the most important entry in the list thus far...  The new
  backronym for EF THEMES is: Extremely Fatigued of Themes Having
  Exaggerated Markings, Embellishments, and Sparkles. 🙃

** Changed the email colours of the ~ef-trio-dark~, ~ef-trio-light~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:da03e5c1-b8b5-43f9-803e-210785d58bc8
:END:

These are two themes that were introduced in the previous version of
the project (=0.6.0=).  In =message.el= buffers, which are used by
Gnus, Mu4e, and Notmuch, the quote levels now have colour combinations
that are closer in spirit to the rest of the theme's aesthetic.

The "trio" themes use magenta, blue, and teal hues.  The previous
design prioritised teal, which broke the established patterns.  It was
not terrible per se, but it did not feel right when switching through
the various contexts.

[ If you think that something "does not feel right" in a given theme,
  please let me know.  I make mistakes and there is always scope for
  refinements or even the creation of a new theme. ]

** Intensified the diff colours of ~ef-spring~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e7a19fde-0073-4f38-8650-d2658d8789d5
:END:

The greens, in particular, were too subtle and could be missed against
the green-tinted light background of the theme.  The new colour values
are consistent with the overall character of the theme, while
improving on the usability of the relevant interfaces.

** Revised the "rainbow" colours for ~ef-winter~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5ae96878-8f85-429d-a092-0b09f929df66
:END:

Each theme's palette has a subset of colour mappings that apply to
constructs such as Org headings.  For ~ef-winter~, those were somewhat
inconsistent with the theme's character, in that they had certain hues
or sequences thereof that stood out more than they should.  The new
design has more harmonious colour combinations.

** Changes to ~ef-deuteranopia-dark~, ~ef-deuteranopia-light~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:21468fe2-2b80-43e1-9f83-7eb3ed41c690
:END:

+ Revised the subset of each theme's palette that applies to graphs or
  related.  These are much better than before, in that they account
  for red-green colour deficiency, but they will never be perfect in
  practice because whatever mode displays graphs needs to be designed
  from the outset with deuteranopia in mind.  For example, the
  ~org-habit~ graph is BY DESIGN unsuitable for colour blindness
  because of the colour coding it introduces combined with the way it
  displays its information. We cannot fix that at the theme level.

+ Tweaked the colour of the backgrounds used in ~dired~ marked items,
  ~org-modern~ TODO or DONE keywords, and related.  These backgrounds
  now stand out a bit more, while retaining their original character.

** Miscellaneous

please let me know.

This is why the principle is to not add customisation options that
introduce colour permutations (e.g. change the intensity of the
'region').  Those will indeed make the project unmaintainable.

Without customisation options, the maintenance is manageable.  It is
basically limited to the occasional tweak to the supported faces.
Granted, now I am still iterating on the individual colour palettes
because we have not yet reached version 1.0.0 (maybe before the end of
the year).

The supported packages are also curated.  Unlike the modus-themes, not
every package is meant to be covered.

In terms of total number of themes, I started working on another light
theme to bring the total number to 16.  I will probably finalise it
tonight or tomorrow.  Then I MIGHT develop two more themes specifically
for tritanopia (blue-yellow colour deficiency), which will be the final
ones.

> Also, do you think that splitting up the theme into multiple packages
> would be a good idea?

I am not against it per se, if there is some practical reason to do it
(e.g. to bundle two of the themes with some other project).  Though now
I feel it is easier to keep them all in one package.
#+end_example

I don't know if the possible tritanopia-optimised themes will be "the
final ones", as there may be scope for more entries.  But this is the
idea for the time being.

** New tri-chrome themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:060dee0b-f18a-4ea4-84f0-8b30ae13ed12

The collection now includes two themes which apply shades of magenta,
blue, and teal in most contexts.  They are named ~ef-trio-dark~ and
~ef-trio-light~.  I think some of you will like their aesthetics.

The announcement includes screenshots (and it also links to the page
with all the pictures of the themes):
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-09-16-ef-themes-trio/>.

As part of the development, I initially forgot to register the "trio"
themes as part of the collection.  Thanks to Sven Seebeck for informing
me about it.  (This is shared with permission, as it was done via a
private channel.)

** Changes to faces or face groups
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:91711f5b-b14c-4840-97fc-ca91b221a265
:END:

+ Removed the override for the ~org-modern-label~ face.  We used to
  affect its properties, which had the unintended effect of breaking the
  functionality of the user option ~org-modern-label-border~.  Users of
  the =org-modern= package may thus notice a difference in the effective
  typography that ~org-modern-mode~ produces.

  For the alignment of tables with timestamps (e.g. clocktables), it is
  recommended to set the user option ~org-modern-timestamp~ to nil.  The
  manual covers this information in the section titled "Tweak
  =org-modern= timestamps".

  Users who still need help with this are welcome to contact me in
  private or via the development channels of the Ef themes (mailing list
  or GitHub/GitLab mirrors).

  Thanks to Daniel Mendler (the =org-modern= developer) for explaining
  the technicalities and correcting errors I made in the previous
  version of that entry in the manual:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/commit/79bb1436f2fd8ab07e850c247c5616490f619f52>.

+ Refined the backgrounds of regexp groupings.  Commands such as
  ~re-builder~ and ~isearch-forward-regexp~ apply distinct colours to
  matching regexp groups.  Those are now optimised to stand out more
  when seen side-by-side.

  Part of this work involved a thorough review of the applicable hues
  used by the ~ef-deuteranopia-dark~ and ~ef-deuteranopia-light~ (the
  two themes which are designed for users with red-green colour
  deficiency).  The announcement on my website shows screenshots,
  including those which simulate deuteranopia:
  <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-09-18-ef-themes-deuteranopia-regexp/>.

+ Added support for ~display-fill-column-indicator-mode~.  Thanks to
  Daniel Mendler for informing me about it (this is shared with
  permission, as it was done via a private channel).

+ Covered two faces that are available on Emacs 29 (current development
  target) for Version Control: ~vc-git-log-edit-summary-max-warning~,
  and ~vc-git-log-edit-summary-target-warning~.

The manual includes improved language on how to use the function
~ef-themes-select~ in user init files.  This is for users who need to
leverage the ~ef-themes-post-load-hook~ at startup (using that hook is
also explained in the manual).  Basically, one loads a theme in their
init file with something like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; like `load-theme' but also call `ef-themes-post-load-hook'
(ef-themes-select 'ef-summer)
#+end_src

** Miscellaneous refinements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c295fd76-473f-4de9-bba8-babc2b97564e
:END:

+ Simplified how the variable ~ef-themes-collection~ gets its value.
  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for suggesting the use of ~seq-union~ over
  at the emacs-devel mailing list:
  <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-09/msg01053.html>.

  I could not use ~seq-union~ because it introduces a dependency on
  Emacs 28, whereas we support Emacs 27.  I went with ~append~ instead.

+ Ensured that the background colour of matching delimiters in
  ~show-paren-mode~ is no longer red-tinted.  We thus avoid the
  potential problem of mistaking those highlights for errors of some
  sort.  This affects the themes ~ef-autumn, ~ef-light~, and ~ef-night~.

+ Recorded the colour distance and colour contrast between the base
  background values across all themes.  The data is incorporated in the
  file =contrast-ratios.org=, which is part of the Git repository and is
  basically intended for my own use as part of this project's
  development (though you are welcome to consult it).

** What you do not see but still need to know about
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:444d811f-fff8-4bbd-8c0c-6da270de0a70
:END:

I worked on two major changes but refrained from implementing them in
this version.  Whether I will do so in the future remains to be
determined.  The first is an option to apply "intense" colouration to
the ~region~ face.  The second pertains to a review of the base
backgrounds across all dark themes in order to improve their contrast
relative to the main background.

The following sections delve into the specifics.  To cut the long story
short: changing colours is not trivial work.

*** Considerations for the "intense" region
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0e1981df-ae21-45b3-b254-ed01c9c5c183
:END:

The following patch is deceptively simple.  It defines some new colour
values, adds a tiny function, and a user option.  Why not add this to
the themes, then?  The reason is that colours are never that simple.
Any new value for the region must (i) work with ~hl-line-mode~, (ii)
respect the highlights of ~show-paren-mode~, (iii) complement or
otherwise not interfere with isearch and its lazy highlights or any
other search utility that can extend the active region highlight, (iv)
keep the cursor visible, and (v) remain thematically consistent with the
rest of the theme.  Running those checks for 14 themes is no mean feat
and there is always the chance that the new colours will still have a
negative effect in places that are not expected.  Furthermore, there is
no guarantee that the number of Ef themes will stay at 14 (I have some
more ideas, yes).

It is for such reasons that one of the principles of this project is to
NOT offer customisation options that influence colours.  They do not
scale and will make things unmaintainable.

*** Revising the dark backgrounds
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:379f696f-3a8a-4454-974f-686a483b65f2
:END:

As with the "intense" region, any change to the base backgrounds has
far-reaching implications.  The following patch is, again, a matter of
making small tweaks to colours values whose effect is far greater than
what meets the eye.  I mean, what can possibly go wrong by changing the
colour =#1a1a1a= to =#232323=, right?  This marginal adjustment
requires, among others, that we also adjust (i) the foregrounds in
header lines, (ii) the background colours of added and removed lines in
Magit focused diff hunks as well as the backgrounds of word-wise, aka
"refined", diff highlights, (iii) the foregrounds of inactive mode
lines, (iv) the legibility of inactive tabs in ~tab-bar-mode~,
~tab-line-mode~, (v) the legibility of elements such as the
=#+begin_src= line in Org buffers, and probably many others.  A change
to one background necessarily needs a change to all others.

This topic is discussed with Alan Schmitt who has one monitor that does
not reproduce black properly:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3C87leqe2tji.fsf%40m4x.org%3E>.

My suggestion is to calibrate hardware, if possible, such as by relying
on those resources:

1. <http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/black.php>
2. <http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/white.php>

[ Yes, I once did spend 8 hours calibrating my monitor.  It was crazy. ]

* Version 0.5.0 on 2022-09-11
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:d0d24c93-7954-4c52-b5a2-79089b53c767
:END:

** New duo-chrome themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:dfdea23c-8d89-4461-8668-04a317fb498d
:END:

The collection now includes two items which apply shades of blue and
yellow in most interfaces.  The themes are named ~ef-duo-dark~ and
~ef-duo-light~.

Read the announcement:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-09-06-ef-themes-duo/>.

View all image samples:
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

The choice of blue and yellow is largely stylistic: it is not done to
accommodate users with red-green colour deficiency.  For that case, the
Ef themes provide ~ef-deuteranopia-dark~ and ~ef-deuteranopia-light~.

** Bespoke accent colours for the mode line
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:db9d8e1d-d33c-46a5-b41c-8bbb19e0b8af
:END:

Each theme now includes a subset of foreground values optimised for use
against the active mode line's background.  The active mode line's
background is accented, meaning that we cannot use colours that are
otherwise decent against the main background.

These new entries are meant to style warnings, errors, and other
notifications that appear on the mode line.  They empower us to extend
support for packages that make use of such colour-coding (more further
below).

** "Subtle" accented backgrounds
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1935e028-10ea-4a3f-adb5-a755c1ddfe2b
:END:

Each theme's palette now contains six accented backgrounds that are not
very intense.  These are used by packages that need to (i) highlight a
line or region, (ii) preserve a modicum of legibility without overriding
existing foreground values (more below about new packages).

** Refined the colour of prompts, where necessary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5a1f7bde-658a-4240-bab8-92cb8e5327b0
:END:

Each theme's palette now includes a dedicated =prompt= mapping.  This
gives us full control over what colour we use for prompts.  In some
themes the prompt will look the same as before, though I made a few
changes to have stylistic consistency in each theme.  Specifically:

| Theme                 | Old prompt   | New prompt     |
|-----------------------+--------------+----------------|
| ef-deuteranopia-dark  | cyan-warmer  | yellow         |
| ef-deuteranopia-light | cyan         | blue           |
| ef-duo-dark           | green-cooler | yellow         |
| ef-duo-light          | green-cooler | blue           |
| ef-spring             | blue         | green          |
| ef-summer             | cyan-cooler  | magenta-warmer |
| ef-winter             | green-cooler | magenta-warmer |

In short: we don't want prompts to look blue/green all the time.  Some
themes have a different character.

** Newly supported packages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:197a98a6-96d3-47ca-935d-6736d3836211
:END:

In general, if a package does not look right, it is not supported by the
Ef themes.  What we have for this release:

+ auctex :: Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for providing the sample file
  that let me view the relevant faces, as well as for helping me
  correct some mistakes of mine:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3C87h71t97hl.fsf%40posteo.net%3E>.

+ company :: Thanks to Alan Schmitt for reminding me about it:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3C87pmgjw3j9.fsf%40m4x.org%3E>.

+ dirvish :: Thanks to Alex Lu (=dirvish= developer) for the
  contribution.  This was done in pull request 14 at the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/14>.  The change is
  below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not require copyright
  assignment to the Free Software Foundation.

+ doom-modeline :: Expanded support for almost all the faces it
  provides.  The only exception is some debugging-related indicators
  that I do not know how to trigger (contact me, if you encounter them).
  This support is made possible by the new accented foregrounds that are
  designed specifically for the mode line.

+ gnus :: Expanded support for all the faces it defines.  I had used
  Gnus for several months before and am familiar with its interfaces.
  Though I never made use of its scoring system.  I think the relevant
  faces look okay, though please let me know if we can refine them
  further.

+ image-dired :: This is made possible by the new "subtle" coloured
  backgrounds that I added to each theme.

+ lin (my package) :: Made possible by the new subtle backgrounds.

+ pulsar (my package) :: Same as above.

+ pulse :: Same.

+ recursion-indicator :: Same

+ selectrum :: Made it look like the already supported =vertico=.

+ tempel :: Same as =lin= and friends.

** Refinements to existing faces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:83fa9e74-0460-49b0-a123-15767d07f806
:END:

+ Lots of small tweaks affect mode line indicators, per the new
  foreground colours I introduced.  Expect to see a bit more colour in
  the mode line when using =magit=, compilation buffers, appointment
  reminders, keyboard macros, Org agenda filters, and more.

+ All the =rcirc= faces have been revised in the interest of thematic
  consistency.

  - Rcirc uses the new foregrounds for the mode line, where relevant.

  - Indicators that track/highlight the user's nick use the same
    paradigm.

  - IRC server messages look like comments in code buffers.

  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for telling me about the downsides of
  using the ~italic~ in the ~rcirc-nick-in-message-full-line~ face:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3C87edwphahl.fsf%40posteo.net%3E>.

  Please note that I am not a regular/experienced IRC user.  If there
  are improvements to be made, I am happy to implement them but will
  likely need your help (I will ask the relevant questions).

** New fallback behaviour for ~ef-themes-toggle~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3399f33c-3d1b-4d18-b50f-8d2f0838aa54
:END:

The command ~ef-themes-toggle~ will switch between two themes specified
in the user option ~ef-themes-to-toggle~.  For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Toggle between `ef-summer' and `ef-winter' using `ef-themes-toggle'.
(setq ef-themes-to-toggle '(ef-summer ef-winter))
#+end_src

By default, ~ef-themes-to-toggle~ is nil. In the past, this meant that
~ef-themes-toggle~ would do nothing out-of-the-box.  To improve the
initial user experience, the command will now fall back to minibuffer
completion to load a theme if ~ef-themes-to-toggle~ does not have the
expected value.  The completion candidates are the items of the Ef
themes collection.  This fallback behaviour is essentially the same as
what the user gets by invoking the ~ef-themes-select~ command.

When ~ef-themes-to-toggle~ is set properly, the corresponding command
will perform the switch, as intended.

This is based on the discussion with Philip Kaludercic about revising
the ~ef-themes-toggle~ command to have a more Do-What-I-Mean behaviour:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3C878rmwfs0e.fsf%40posteo.net%3E>.

** Improved how ~ef-themes-load-random~ picks subsets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4407d5a6-b837-4168-88b2-f7b175978122
:END:

The ~ef-themes-load-random~ command accepts a prefix argument (=C-u=, by
default): it prompts the user for a =dark= or =light= subset out of the
collection.  Once that is selected, the command loads a theme at random.

Before, the prompt was using minibuffer completion, but this has now
changed to a ~read-multiple-choice~ function, meaning that =d= selects
=dark= and =l= selects =light=.  Basically, we skip possible extra key
presses.

Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the patch:
<https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/35089>.

** Internal changes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b9156099-0bcd-4974-9cdf-ada73d5745ce
:END:

+ Fixed the initial colors' list in the ~ef-themes-with-colors~ macro.
  Thanks to Steve Molitor for telling me that the previous design would
  not work if ~ef-light~ was not loaded.  This was done in issue 11 at
  the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/11>.

+ Simplified the helper function ~ef-themes--current-theme~.  Thanks to
  Jonas Collberg for the feedback in issue 12 over at the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/12>.  Also thanks to
  Jonas for the subsequent patch in pull request 13:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/13>.  The change is
  below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not require copyright
  assignment to the Free Software Foundation.

+ Refined the colour mapping of some themes to improve overall
  aesthetics and/or usability, without deviating from the theme's
  established character.  For example, in the ~ef-dark~ I adjusted the
  mappings for dates, links, and names.  This helps distinguish all
  elements, while retaining the overall looks of the design.  Some
  contexts where that is relevant:

  - Notmuch search buffers
  - Magit commit log
  - Org clocktables
  - Org documents with links, to-do, etc.

  I will not cover all such technicalities.  Please consult the Git
  commit log.  If, however, some new combination of colours feels
  awkward, you are welcome to tell me about it.

+ Made improvements to the manual and implemented other internal
  changes.

** New deuteranopia-friendly themes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f94f8637-73c8-4e43-bc70-c17c42e76ad6
:END:

Designed two bespoke themes for users with red-green colour deficiency
or blindness (deuteranopia).  They rely on blue and yellow hues.  Their
names are:

+ ~ef-deuteranopia-dark~
+ ~ef-deuteranopia-light~

Announcement with sample pictures:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-08-19-ef-themes-deuteranopia/>.

** User options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3dc43b00-843b-4827-b7cd-f381de619433
:END:

+ Introduced the variable ~ef-themes-mixed-fonts~.  When it is set to a
  non-nil (=t=) value, it makes spacing-sensitive elements use a
  monospaced font.  For example, Org tables and code blocks will always
  look properly aligned.  This is useful for those who either use a
  proportionately spaced font as their default or enable the built-in
  ~variable-pitch-mode~.

+ Implemented the variable ~ef-themes-variable-pitch-ui~.  When it is
  set to a non-nil (=t=) value, it renders the mode-line, tab-bar-mode,
  and tab-line-mode in a proportionately spaced font.

User options must be set before the theme is loaded.  If an option
changes, its value will be read upon a theme re-load.

For font configurations, refer to my =fontaine= package.

** Refinements to faces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:582dea7b-454a-4500-871b-4ec45e875274
:END:

+ Fixed the scaling of current line of ~display-line-numbers-mode~ when
  ~text-scale-adjust~ was invoked.  Basically I forgot to include the
  ~line-number~ face, while all others were covered.  Thanks to Anthony
  Chavez for the feedback in issue 7 over at the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/7>.

+ Covered all faces that define group titles in completion contexts.
  These are headings which are used by various commands, such as
  ~consult-buffer~, ~consult-imenu~, and ~consult-grep~.  As they denote
  a group name, we apply the =name= colour mapping (the hue differs for
  each theme).  And since they are titles, we inherit from ~bold~ to
  make them look like headings.  Thanks to Summer Emacs for the feedback
  which amounted to:

  1. Treating group titles as headings.
  2. Using a more consistent colour theme-wide.

+ Revised the ~compilation-info~ face from a colour-coded "success" face
  to a value that is consistent with the semantics of its application in
  file names or related (as seen in the emacs.git repository).  For
  example, file names in Grep or Xref buffers will now look like they
  belong to the theme, whereas before they were predominantly green,
  even when that did not make sense.  This point is connected to the
  above, such as in workflows that go from the minibuffer to a Grep
  buffer (e.g. with the use of the =embark= package).

+ Toned down the vertical border between windows by explicitly
  supporting the ~vertical-border~ face.  The previous design would use
  the main foreground which generally led to a disproportionately
  intense result.

+ Adjusted all spacing-sensitive faces to accommodate the user option
  ~ef-themes-mixed-fonts~, as noted above.  Also thanks to Christopher
  League for spotting that I had missed the ~line-number~ face and for
  providing the relevant patch (I do the same in the =modus-themes=):
  https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/%3C871qt2x4wi.fsf%40nita.mail-host-address-is-not-set%3E

  The patch is well below the ~15 line threshold and thus does not
  require copyright assignment to the Free Software Foundation.

+ Enforced mono spacing for the ~org-indent~ face.  This is essential
  for ~org-indent-mode~ to align entries correctly.  Thanks to Steve
  Molitor for reporting this in the issue 9 over at the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/9>.  Steve tested a
  sample file with ~modus-vivendi~ and got the desired results.  It
  reminded me how I handle this face in the =modus-themes=.

+ Added explicit support for the ~bold~ and ~italic~ faces.  The default
  definition of ~italic~ has conditionality which we do not want, such
  as drawing an underline if the font does not have italics (e.g. Fira
  Code).  Styling it at the theme level prevents that from happening:
  the font without italics will simply use the upright/roman glyphs.
  Adding ~bold~ is just for clarity.  Its default definition is fine.

+ Made the tabs of the built-in ~tab-bar-mode~ and ~tab-line-mode~ stand
  out more.  The difference between the current tab and the rest was too
  subtle.  Depending on the lighting conditions, their respective
  backgrounds were indistinguishable.  Thanks to Summer Emacs for
  reporting this issue and for helping me decide on the final design.

+ Applied tinted backgrounds to values and arguments in transient.el
  buffers (e.g. Magit).  They now stand out better.

** Documentation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5549f628-390d-478c-b8d3-a0b068f3f1e0
:END:

+ Created a page with screenshots of all the Ef themes:
  <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures>.

+ Answered the Frequently Asked Question of letting Org tags inherit the
  foreground colour of the heading they belong to.  The gist (though
  note that the entry also mentions the option for the non-alignment of
  tags):

  #+begin_quote
  Upstream Org defines tags in headings to have the same color as the rest
  of the heading's text.  However, tags are a distinct component of the
  heading as noted in the doc string of the ~org-get-heading~ function.
  Tags also are functionally different than the ordinary text of the
  heading: they are a clickable link/button.  It thus is a matter of
  usability to render this distinction clear at the visual level: I do not
  agree with upstream Org's design decision.
  #+end_quote

+ Addressed another Frequently Asked Question on whether we can have
  Ef-style themes inspired by the Nord or Zenburn themes.  The short
  version is that this is technically difficult and undesirable.  Each
  palette in the Ef themes collection is original and is designed around
  the normative and aesthetic principles of this project.

+ Wrote an entire section on Do-It-Yourself customisations.  These
  generally are for advanced users, though the manual provides concrete
  examples of using the ~ef-themes-with-colors~ macro in tandem with the
  ~ef-themes-post-load-hook~.

+ Elaborated on the list of packages that I will most likely NOT support
  in the Ef themes.  The reasons vary though.  Quote:

  #+begin_quote
  These are difficult to support due to their (i) incompatibility with
  the design of the =ef-themes=, (ii) complexity or multiple points of
  entry, (iii) external dependencies, (iv) existence of better
  alternatives in my opinion, or (v) inconsiderate use of color
  out-of-the-box and implicit unwillingness to be good Emacs citizens
  #+end_quote

  If a certain package does not look right, then it is not supported
  (yet).

The manual can be read from Emacs, if the =ef-themes= package is
installed.  Evaluate:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(info "(ef-themes) Top")
#+end_src

** Internal refinements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4013a8aa-d2ff-45a1-95db-edd140e31cb1
:END:

+ Recalibrated diff colours or the context of diff buffers, especially
  in Magit, to improve usability.

+ Adjusted or otherwise tweaked the hues that apply to key bindings and
  links in order to reinforce the stylistic consistency of each theme.

+ Introduced a yellow-tinted background which is used in various
  contexts that (i) should be styled with a coloured background but (ii)
  should not be colour-coded as either red or green/blue.

+ Made the ~ef-themes-with-colors~ macro always reify the current Ef
  theme's palette.  This macro is for advanced users.  Its utility is
  documented in the themes' manual.

+ Fixed how themes become "known" at startup.  Before, they were not
  registered correctly for immediate use with the ~ef-themes-select~
  command.  Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the feedback in issue
  6 over at the GitHub mirror: <https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/6>.

+ Tweaked some face attributes to work with Emacs 27.

+ Tinkered with the colour mapping or precise values of practically all
  the themes.  Better consult the Git log for the minutiae.  I think the
  identity of each theme is largely defined, though there may still be
  tweaks to be done here and there until we eventually reach version
  =1.0.0=.

** User-facing changes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:691f108f-7a92-47a9-a3a3-89c31916d8c8
:END:

+ Revised the minimum Emacs version of the =ef-themes= package.  It now
  depends on Emacs 27.1 instead of Emacs 28.1.  Relevant internal
  adjustments were made, some of which are courtesy of Philip
  Kaludercic: <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/34787>.

  [ Philip has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.  This
    is necessary for all non-trivial patches. ]

+ Added two new themes to the collection which are designed for users
  with red-green colour deficiency/blindness (deuteranopia).  In simple
  terms, their effective palette consists of blue, yellow, and the base
  tones.  The themes are named descriptively: ~ef-deuteranopia-dark~ and
  ~ef-deuteranopia-light~.  Announcement with screenshots:
  <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-08-19-ef-themes-deuteranopia/>.

+ Reconsidered the principle of what kind of user options are
  acceptable.  Those which affect colours directly will never be a part
  of the project.  Others are subject to consideration with a preference
  for simplicity.  Detailed documentation to do-it-yourself will still
  be preferred over user options.

+ Implemented the ~ef-themes-headings~ user option which provides the
  mechanism to change the weight and height of each heading level, as
  well as set it to ~variable-pitch~ (i.e. a proportionately spaced
  font).  The doc string of that variable or the relevant entry in the
  manual explain the particularities and provided code samples.

  To accommodate this variable, the default style of all headings has
  been revised to remove the added height they once had.  Users who
  preferred the previous style must add the following to their
  configuration BEFORE the code that actually loads the theme (e.g. a
  ~load-theme~ call):

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Restore height of each heading level to its previous value.
  (setq ef-themes-headings
        '((0 . (1.9))
          (1 . (1.8))
          (2 . (1.7))
          (3 . (1.6))
          (4 . (1.5))
          (5 . (1.4))
          (6 . (1.3))
          (7 . (1.2))
          (t . (1.1))))

  ;; First set the above configuration, then load the theme (changes to
  ;; user options require a theme re-load).
  (load-theme 'ef-summer :no-confirm)
  #+end_src

+ Introduced the command ~ef-themes-toggle~ and the companion user
  option ~ef-themes-to-toggle~.  To use the command, one must first set
  their two preferred Ef themes, such as with this:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq ef-themes-to-toggle '(ef-summer ef-winter))
  #+end_src

  The names of all the themes are included in the ~ef-themes-collection~
  variable.  Though recall that the commands ~ef-themes-select~ and
  ~ef-themes-load-random~ still use the entire collection (read their
  doc strings or consult the manual).

+ Fixed how themes are made available at startup.  Before, there was a
  mistake to how items were registered as "known" and were thus not
  recognised by our commands, even though the standard ~load-theme~
  worked as expected.  Thanks to Iris Garcia for reporting the problem
  in issue 2 on the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/2>.  It was
  propagated to users as version 0.2.1 of the =ef-themes=.

+ Added support for these packages:

  - chart
  - doom-modeline (tentative)
  - info
  - org-habit
  - rcirc
  - smerge

  Thanks to Spike-Leung for reminding me about ~org-habit~ in issue 5
  over at the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/5>.

  [ Remember that if a package looks awfully out of place, it is not
    support (yet). ]

+ Expanded and/or clarified the manual, including an answer to the
  question of what "Ef" means:

  #+begin_quote
  "Ef" is a Greek word (ευ), commonly used as a prefix to denote that
  something is good, nice, and/or easy.  For example, eftopia (ευτοπία)
  is the opposite of dystopia (δυστοπία): a good place as opposed to a
  bad place.
  #+end_quote

+ Helped Adam Sherwood figure out why zsh-autosuggestions did not look
  right.  In short: this has nothing to do with Emacs.  Try to avoid
  termcolor{0,7,8,15} as a default.  Prefer the remaining nominal accent
  colours, as every theme is more likely to work with those, whereas,
  say, termcolor0 ("black") will not be legible with dark themes.  This
  was done in issue 3 on the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/3>.

** Internal refinements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:bf3fcbee-9057-497a-8258-2ef8029a3459
:END:

+ Recalibrated lots of colour values and mappings across several themes.
  The changes are small and help with the internal consistency of each
  theme.  Consult the Git commit log for the minutiae.

+ The internal faces for headings are now done with a ~dotimes~ call on
  ~custom-declare-face~ instead of a bespoke macro.  Thanks to Philip
  Kaludercic for the patch:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/34791>.

+ Applied ~file-equal-p~ for the registration of the themes in the
  relevant path.  Doing so is generally more resilient than ~equal~ and
  might avoid an unexpected edge case in the future.  Thanks to Philip
  Kaludercic for the patch:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/34789>.

+ Opted for ={if,when}-let*= over ={if,when}-let=.  The former do not
  support the obsolete single-binding syntax, and make clear that both
  macros operate more like ~let*~ than ~let~ by evaluating and binding
  variables sequentially.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the patch:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/ef-themes/patches/34787>.

** Acknowledgement for the first version of the project

:END:

Thanks to user Summer Emacs whose feedback helped define the identity of
the ~ef-summer~ theme.  Summer's comments pertained to the need to
increase the occurence of yellow as the theme used to be predominantly
magenta and purple.  I thus implemented the revised colour mapping and
made the relevant adjustments.  Without Summer's comments, ~ef-summer~
wouldn't have been as pretty.

[ Added after the fact on 2022-08-20 ]

No release notes were produced at the time.  This version included
various stylistic refinements and added commands for (i) loading a theme
and (ii) previewing a theme's colour palette.

The commands which load a theme call the =ef-themes-post-load-hook=.
Advanced and/or do-it-yourself users may have a use for it.  The manual
will eventually provide specific code samples.

* Version 0.1.0 on 2022-08-17

There were no release notes for it.  It established the foundations of
the project: the main macros, the character of each theme, etc.  Check
the Git commit log for more.
